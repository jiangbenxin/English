Hey, Clara! You don’t look too well today.

Yeah, I am having some trouble right now.

Oh, no! What’s wrong?

Well, I forgot to pay my rent and my landlord isn’t too happy about it.

Hm… Do you need me to lend you some money?

Oh, no! That’s not what I am here for.

Sorry! What can I help you with then?

Can I stay here with you for a few days?

Oh, sure! Of course!

You are a lifesaver, Emma!

Haha, it’s nothing! So do you wanna come in now?

I should probably get back to my place and pack some stuff.

Okay! Then I will clean the guest room for you.

You’re too nice!

Don’t worry about it! What are friends for?

Thank you again! I really appreciate it!

Oh, hush! Now go! Pack your stuff and get back here. We are going to have so much fun!

Okay. See you in an hour.

Hey everyone, so today we are doing a very exciting video. In this video, we are going to be diving into some of the most beautiful, most magical pieces I could find on the internet. And it’s going to be fun. I hope. 

Nay. I promise. You have the MIA guarantee which is nearly worthless. I have found this wide array of beautiful products in multiple different places. Pinterest. Instagram and I can’t wait to show you the pieces. So let me not ramble and let’s just get into it.

Okay, so the first beautiful piece are these sets. This is from a brand called Work From Beach *Be Like* and I actually found them based on this photo of other companies stealing their design and using not just their design but also their photos to Market their own product. I found this after I had already shopped what I thought was the real over on Etsy.

Oh, it looks like the one that I bought is actually taken down. Maybe they took it down because Work From Beach Be Like maybe called them out. I’m not sure.

Do you know the woman who just came into our office?

Who?

The one with the short yellow hair.

I see a couple of women with short yellow hair.

The one wearing the pink dress, with black eyes, a high nose, and a beautiful smallmouth. She is very good-looking.

Oh. That’s the new director’s assistant. Her name is Alice.

Really? When did she join our company? Why didn’t I know?

She has just joined us this Monday. You had a day-off on this day, right?

Ah, yes. How are her characteristics?

She is very intelligent and friendly.

Ok. Let me get acquanited with her.

Yes. You should do that.

Behind me are the most expensive cars in the world. No joke. We got our hands on over $250 million worth of cars. One of them even costing $100 million. 

And we’re going to be exploding, sailing, driving and even flying all of these cars to show you why they’re so expensive. Starting with this $1 car, literally a rust bucket.

“Why are you selling this car for a dollar?”

“Well, you see, it’s pretty much worthless. And I can’t put any time or money in this thing.”

“If you grab this dollar, the deal is final.”

Now, obviously, this is a piece of garbage, but when you spend 20 K on repairs, it actually runs.

“All right, let’s get this bad boy started.”

I do not think it would start.

“How is this thing driving?”

It smells like smoke. This is crazy.

One dollar car!  One dollar car! One dollar car!

All right, well, that was the $1 car.

“**Glad** I wasn’t in that.”

Bringing the $100,000 car, which drives itself. No joke. No one is currently in this car, and it is moving.

### 01-03

What is this?

I need you to see something.

Just put the fucking glasses on.

Welcome to Thea, Mr. Kenzaki.

Who are you?

My name is Xavia Grey. I’m head of the SIREN **corporation** and founder of the Thea Project. Would you like this experience in English or Japanese?

English is fine.

As you know, Thea exists in the Nexus constellation, situated five light years from Earth. Thea is the only planet we’ve discovered thus far that can sustain human life. We at SIREN are currently in the process of its colonization. It is our intention to create a base for millions. Perhaps one day, even billions. As our colony expands, we require a constant influx of workers to create an infrastructure. An opportunity we would like to offer to you.

You want me to build houses?

I want you to be a part of the most important project in our species history. And you’ll be given something in return.

What’s that?

We refer to it as tabula rasa. A blank slate. When you depart Earth for Thea, we’ll erase your past completely. We’re giving you the chance to really start afresh. 

You don’t keep records of who we are?

This is a new world, Mr. Kenzaki. A world without fetters. A world without judgment. A world where your history no longer has any relevance. Here, you have the opportunity to become whatever you want to be.

It can’t be that easy.

We’re five light years from Earth. Who’s going to stop us? This concludes your introductory experience of the Thea Project. I hope you’ll consider joining our mission.

Wait, wait, wait.

### 01-04

Ah! It’s so cute! My spirit animals. That one looks like my cat. Oh my God, this looks like me when I eat too much cereal. Bloated and chubs.  

I’m from Pennsylvania, born and raised. **This is my family and I.** It’s little me. I was called the devil growing up, because I always had a stank face.  

During my finals week in high school. I got an email saying you have to come to New York, we have a really prestigious brand and photographer that wants to work with you. 

They didn’t tell me exactly yet who is was. But once I got to New York, they said okay, you’re meeting Stephen Mizell.   

So I have two, I have my blue one is for just my daily routine, schedule, things I want to get done. Land at 12 P.M. **arrive home**, order food, **clean up**, unpack, **workout**, question mark, shower, question, no, **I’m just kidding,** **I** definitely showered, and then I have my personal journal.  

This baby is like sacred to me, and I end up like drawing in it.

### 01-05

Flat feet!  

I would never wear heels if my feet were shaped this way.

Hey! **What’s cooking**, good-looking？

Hi.

Welcome. Welcome to my Weirdhouse. Hi, how are you? 

Nice to meet you. 

Sorry about the dog crap. What can I do you for?

I just had to come see you about my feet. They’re, um…

Flat. 

Yeah.

Never seen that before.

Really? 

Whoa. 

Okay. Well, can you, you know, fix them?

You’re Stereotypical Barbie, right?

uh-huh.

And what preceded this?

Oh, nothing. A really fun game of volleyball.

That’s it? 

Thoughts of death.

What is it?

Maybe some thoughts of death?

Thoughts of death!

Is that a problem?

Oh…

What?

I’ve heard of this. Of course, I didn’t think it was possible, but it’s real. Oh, you’ve done it. You’ve opened a portal.

I didn’t open a portal. 

Someone did. And now, there is a rip in the continuum. That is the membrane between Barbie Land and the Real World, and if you wanna be Stereotypical Barbie perfect again, then, baby girl, you gotta go fix it. Or you’re gonna keep going funny. Look at your upper thigh. 

What is that?

That’s cellulite. That’s gonna spread everywhere. 

What?

And then you’re gonna start getting sad and mushy and complicated.

No!

What do I have to do?

You have to go to the Real World.

Okay.

And you have to find the girl who’s playing with you.

Playing with me?

We’re all being played with, babe. But usually, there’s some kind of separation. Thanks. There’s the girl and the doll. And never the twain shall cross.

The twain is crossing? 

Yes. And the girl who’s playing with you, she must be sad, and her thoughts and feelings and humanness are interfering with your **doll**ness.

Why would she be sad? We fixed everything so that all women in the Real World can be happy and powerful.

I don’t know, but if you ask me, you had something to do with this, too.

Me?

Takes two to rip a portal.

I can’t have. I’ve only ever wanted for everything to stay exactly as it is.

Well, be that as it may, the two of you are becoming inextricably intertwined. And you gotta help her to help yourself. 

So, should…Whoo! 

So, what’ll it be then? You can go back to your **regular life** and forget any of this ever happened, or you can know the truth about the universe. The choice is now yours.

The first one. The high heel.

### 01-06

I‘m Laci Fay and I live every day like it’s 1958. People’s reaction is…it’s almost always positive.  

This is who I am. This is what I like and I feel like.  

You should do what you like, you should do what makes you feel beautiful and dress however you want, a dress that makes you feel the most like you. 

People will stop dead in their tracks and they’ll just stop, and their eyes are fixed on her as we’ll walk by. 

One place in town that kind of brings in the nineteen fifties vibe, quite well, is the local pharmacy, it’s called Bulloch Drug, and they have a **soda** **fountain**, they have a jukebox and makes it a lot of fun. 

I really honed in on the 1950s because of my grandparents. They got married in 1955 and their stories, it just made it sound like the best time ever. Everything’s beautiful, colorful, happy, optimistic. 

We bought our home four years ago, yeah, it was built in 1953. We tried to pack as much in as we can while keeping it authentic. I don’t want it to look like it’s a fifties museum, I want it to look like it’s an authentic nineteen fifties home that you’ve walked into

### 01-07

I’ve lived with just 111 possessions, all of which fit into a backpack just like this. I also lived with just 44 possessions, which fit into a day pack.  

And I’ve biked across the United States three times with all of my gear on my bicycle. Right now, I actually own about 600 possessions, and about half of those are jars, because I do a lot of foraging and growing food, and I store that food.  

I’ve been simplifying and downsizing my life for over a decade, and today I wanna share with you what I would own if everything fit into just a backpack and into my bicycle and the bags on that bicycle.  

What I mean to show you is how to live simply, how to live freely, and at the same time, how to live sustainably and deeply connected to the Earth, and to our communities. So, I’m gonna go ahead and show you my clothing, which is one of the most important categories of items that I own. 

Generally, I own about five T-shirts. They are all green. And I own a wool sweater, typically about two pairs of shorts, one pair of lighter pants, and then generally a more heavy-duty pair of pants, and a hat that has a large brim to keep the sun, especially off the nose. So, at this exact moment, I just owned 12 items of clothing, and it’s summertime.  

Normally, I would own more items of clothing than this, and there are more items that I’m going to be getting. Some of the really key ones are a pair of long underwear, wool is ideal for that. An another hat, a winter hat, which also for me, wool is ideal for that. 

A jacket, a couple of pairs of socks, wool are ideal for that as well. And also a really helpful item that I do not currently have is a rain jacket or even potentially a rain suit. And then of course, shoes.

Sulbin is about to push his body almost beyond the realms of possibility. And if you want to try and join him, get ready to hold your breath for as long as you can. He takes one last breath. 

Focused and calm. Sulbin descends 20 meters to the seafloor. His heartbeat slows to around 30 beats per minute. The pressure at these depths crushes his chest, squeezing the air in his lungs to 1/3 of its usual volume.  

Even without weights, he’s negatively buoyant enough to stride across the bottom of the sea as if hunting on land. By now the carbon dioxide in his blood causes an almost irresistible urge to gasp for air, but Sulbin must keep his mind on the hunt.  

After a minute and three-quarters. Sulbin spots a fish. Sulbin can go even deeper than this and stay down for up to five minutes. But he’s not one to show off, and after all he’s got what he came for. Two and a half minutes of hunting under pressure on one breath. Perhaps the idea of humans existing as marine mammals is not so far-fetched after all.

This is the Dark Side of Vietnam.

As most travelers know, Vietnam’s nightlife is **popular** among tourists and one of the most well-known nightlife destinations is Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City, but if you think you’re going to meet the love of your life during these outings, think again. 

There are plenty of cases of dating scams in Vietnam. A popular method is the bar girl scam. Beautiful girls who work for the club will approach you, will ask you for an expensive drink and then tell you a tragic life story. That way, they can earn your sympathy and use you for your money. Most of the time it turns out the girl works for the club and gets a commission.  

The worst case *scena*rio is they’ll borrow your money and never see you again. Then there’s the travel scam. They will first contact you via social media or **dating websites** and ask you to visit them. They’ll volunteer to make travel arrangements and ask you to pay for it. After the money is received, you’ll never hear from her again. 

One crime that is on the rise in Vietnam is human trafficking. The country was even *dub*bed as a trafficking *hub* for its region. Most of the victims were trafficked to foreign countries, but police claim that trafficking cases **within** Vietnam are also on the rise. 

From 2018 to 2022, there were around 440 cases of human trafficking, ranging from sexual exploitation, labor exploitation and even human organ trade. One particular ploy the traffickers use is promising an easy job with high incomes **doing illegal work** in a foreign country to the victims, if they wanna return, they need to pay a high fee. Another *ploy* is by promising to marry them off or giving them up for adoption, after the victim is out of Vietnam, they’ll seize all the victim's papers and force them to work illegally.

I just dropped off Marzia at the hospital. We think tomorrow it will happen, so she’s gonna stay overnight and tomorrow I’ll be a dad.  

I’m very nervous. I’m nervous for Marzia, but I know she’s gonna do super well. I know. She’s really good at this kind of thing. She’ always a bit scared but I know she can totally handle it really well. Yeah, I feel bad I’m leaving her alone, but I will be there hopefully when Bjorn is born. I’m just gonna hang with the puggies for the **time being**. 

Björn is born. I don’t wanna great. He’s so cute. I am officially a dad. 

Check this out, this has been here for nine months and my little 3D cat. So you paint one eye before you have a wish and then you paint the other eye when the wish is completed. I don’t know exactly if that’s what it is. It’s a DaRUMa. But it’s time to paint the eye and then we burn it at New Year’s. I never completed one before, that was a terrible eye. 

He just poops and piss, poops and eats and sleeps. This is not a bad life.

We’re gonna give him a little stampy. 

Sometimes I look at him and I’m like, did I clone myself? This is some weird sci-fi movie? And then you’re like, oh yeah, that’s how babies work. He’s got mice’s hair color though. So much hair, man, it’s been really cozy. Mainly just been reading, playing video games, working out. We’ve been advised here in Japan. You’re not supposed to bring your baby out for a month, but it’s been too…he’s pooping, it’s been too, uh, hot and sun is too strong anyway, well, we can soon take him out which will be fun. I can’t wait to leave the house. 

### 02-02

It's an epic showdown between boy and beast. 7-year-old Huxley Hardy Penner comes face to face with a black bear while riding a scooter. Watches the bear approaches the boy heading right towards him in broad daylight. 

Without panicking, Huxley stares the animal down, looking directly at him until the bear stops dead in his tracks.  

No one could predict what would happen next, then out of nowhere Huxley’s neighbor appears with his arms raised high, the neighbor turns into a superhero and fearlessly approaches the animal, engaging the bear in a heart-stopping game of hide and seek. Watches the neighbor **relent****less****ly** pursues the bear from behind the car until the animal finally gets spooked and goes scurrying away. Crisis averted.  

We spoke with Huxley and his mom Britney about the grizzly encounter which took place in British Columbia, Canada. 

“We’ve had conversations about being aware, hey, be aware of your surroundings if there is a bear and you’re not with an adult. You the… you know, be calm. “ 

Wildlife experts stress that staying calm and looking big and overpowering are key responses when **confront**ing a bear in the outdoors. 

So cheers to Huxley and his neighbor for their perfect response under pressure. 

“I think most adults even in that moment would have... perhaps panicked or run away or you know not everybody knows what to do there, so I’m super proud of them.” 

And off Huxley goes on his scooter to his next adventure.

### 02-03

I’m gonna spend the next seven days buried alive under 20,000 pounds of dirt. This is the scariest thing I have ever done. 

All right, well, I guess it’s time, bury me alive.

That was scary.

This is gonna be terrifying.

This is pretty much most people’s worst fear.

Oh, my God. That dirt is terrifying.

Brace yourself. Ha ha ha. 

Drop the payload.

Oh, God. I feel like, I need to hold the roof. 

Oh，my roof is shaking. 

I’m entrusting my life to this coffin for the next seven days. Let’s pray it doesn’t just randomly decide to **break**. 

And obviously, this goes without saying, but yes, this is 100% real. And I’ll be honest, I severely underestimated how hard this was going to be.  

All I have to survive the next seven days…is the food in this briefcase, which is basically just some MREs and snacks. My foot went numb. Five gallon drum of water over there. 

And when day two was coming to a close, the boys left me to go spend time by their RV.   

I’ve got an idea. We’ll play construction noises over the speakers. So that way he doesn’t hear the **excavator**. 

There’s a **loud noise**, and no one’s answering over the walkie. So either I’m about to die. 

It’s like playing a video game. **Except for** you could accidentally kill somebody. I’m not certified to do this at all.  

I am bored in a coffin. 

We definitely stayed up all night and dug this tunnel and didn’t pay that guy to do it. 

What is that sound I hear?

Hi, Jimmy. 

What?

Hi, Jimmy! Do you see us? 

I see Nolan’s forehead.

Yeah, it’s hard to miss.

How long did it take to dig that tunnel? 

Literally all night, Jimmy.

I was so down bad that there was only one thing in this world that could possibly cheer me up.

Jimmy, I brought somebody. 

Who’d you bring?  

My parents.

Oh, How’s it going? 

Well, have you talked about Nolan’s mom at all since you’ve been down there?

No, not whatsoever. 

And the picture?

I don’t know what you’re talking about. 

We’re getting you out, Jimmy.

This is the worst part of the challenge. Because now I’m waiting for my *stupid friends* to dig me up. 

Jimmy, this Santa Claus dude looking guy is gonna bring you out now. 

Karl, I don’t care what he looks like. Just get me out of this coffin. 

Dig, dig, dig, dig.

Oh, that’s the excavator. Oh, that’s scary. 

I can see sunlight.

Jimmy. 

How’s it going? It’s hard to describe what the sun looks like after not seeing it for seven days straight. 

Oh, my gosh. I started crying once again. I’m not sure why. I just couldn’t help it. We did it. 

Jimmy, you ready?

Don’t drop it on me. 

I bet it *stink*s in there.

Oh, my God. My legs are **weak**, but **the real surprise** was waiting for me just above ground. Oh, wow, there’s so many people. 

After seven days, I was finally able to celebrate 200 million **subscriber**s, the right way. We have to celebrate 200 million, bro.

### 02-04

I didn’t wanna make this video. I’m sorry if what I did offended you. I was in a dark place. I’m human. I was young and have now grown as a person. I have depression and anxiety. I’m the actual victim. I don’t think I actually did anything wrong. I would never do the things it’s been proven I’ve done. I’m gonna take a long two day break from **social media**. Buy my merch and subscribe. Let’s get it guys, that’s a world record right there. **World record**.

### 02-05

When I was young, as you know, I had a difficult childhood. But there’s no excuse for people not being able to do what they want to do. You can do anything that you want to do.  

Fox example, as I’ve told you before I lived in the back of an old car. I had taught myself to read and write. 

So if you’re young, don’t give up. Don’t say, the world is just against me. That’s not true. I taught myself to read and write. I’ve had five books published.  

I went to college, got a little bit of college. I’ve studied scripture for many many years. I’ve raised five children. I’ve buried a mother, father, sister, brother, wife and daughter. So a person can accomplish anything that they want. **One time** to prove to myself that I was not an **ignorant person**, I bought a blackboard, and I purchased a **corresponde****nce** course for **computer programming** and I completed it with the blackboard. So **forge** **ahead**, **don’t stop**. **Never stop learning**. Always reach out to better yourself, because when you do that, things expand. You understand more, you’re happier, you’re healthier. 

This old saying that, if you don’t use it, you lose it. It’s absolutely true. If you don’t use that brain that God put in your head, **one of these days**, you’ll be sitting on a **front porch** somewhere, and you **won’t** **hardly** **know** what’s going on.  

So **don’t give up**. If times are hard, good things nor bad things last forever. But most generally, we are in control of our own destiny.

### 02-06

Excuse me. Excuse me. You. Yes, you. **May I talk to you**.  

Whoa… hey, this is private property. 

Just a minute, I wanna talk to you.

No, no, not interest, **come on**.

Hey, don’t touch me. Do not touch me. 

All right, look, not touching, okay. Not touching here. Look, lady, whatever you’re selling, I ain’t buying, yo. 

Well, my name is Skyler White, yo. My husband is Walter White, yo. Uh-huh. He told me everything.

Seriously.

That’s right, and just so you know, my brother-in-law is an DEA agent, and I will not hesitate to call him not if I have to. Understood. This is your one and only warning, do not sell marijuana to my husband. 

Okay.

I mean it. Don’t call our house again. You **stay away from** him, or you will be one sorry individual. You get me？ 

I…uh…think so, yeah. Um, no more marijuana. I can…I can dig it.

You can dig it. Wonderful.

Not that it’s any of my business but, you might wanna consider a different line of work.

### 02-07

Good afternoon! It is a great honor for me to be here in Shanghai and to have this opportunity to speak with all of you. I’d like to thank Fudan University‘s president Yang, for his hospitality and his **gracious welcome**. I’d also like to thank our outstanding ambassador Jon Huntsman, who exemplifies the deep ties and respect between our nations. I don’t know what he said but I hope it was good. 

What I’d like to do is to make some opening remarks and then what I’m really looking forward to doing is **taking questions**. Not only from students who are in the audience, but also we’ve received questions online, which will be asked by some of the students who are here in the audience as well as by ambassador Huntsman, 

and I’m very sorry that my Chinese is not as good as your English, but I am looking forward to this chance to have a dialogue. 

This is my first time traveling to China and I’m excited to see this **majestic country**. Here in Shanghai, we see the *growth* that has caught the attention of the world. The soaring skyscrapers, the **bustling streets** and **entrepreneurial activity**, and just as I’m impressed by these signs of China’s Journey to the 21st century.  

I’m eager to see those ancient places that speak to us from China’s distant past. Tomorrow and the next day I hope to have a chance when I’m in Beijing to see the **majesty** of The Forbidden City and the wonder of the Great Wall.

### 02-08

It's a pleasure to have you, Yuhui.
My pleasure.
So when you first started, there was a time that you couldn’t sell. You had very few followers, five to say？
Five or four. Yeah.
Yeah, did you see a point of making that effort？And why did you carry on？What made you carry on？
I wasn’t myself at the beginning when I was trying to sell goods to viewers in front of a screen. I belittled myself. I thought that was meaningless. Cuz I used to be a teacher, an English teacher for eight years. So I defined myself as someone who spreads the knowledge, and what ambition, what mission they should make for their future. I am not the person to yell in front of the screen. That wasn’t something a teacher should do. 
You don’t take pride in what you had to do.
I didn’t find the turning point, even though the world was changing for me. Collapsed and reconstructed again. I didn’t realize that, I was too obsessed with my past. 
Until one day, I learned a story, behind a farm product from Gansu province. A small county. Young people go to big cities for better jobs. The elderly, lack of care, and they still need to work in the fields. So, I suddenly realized that, yeah, that was me. Come on. You were from a certain kind of village just like that. 
A small county just like that. You tried hard, you learned a lot, and then now you have the chance to do the right thing. Why are you hesitating for a long time？So, I suddenly realized that. I cannot be obsessed with my past as a teacher. I do enjoy it, but when you have no choice, make your current choice correct.
So, in a way, you are becoming more mature of accepting criticism compared to when you were a teacher.
Definitely. Yeah. You can still find 
very…like…haha…unfriendly feedback from the internet for me. I heard it. I saw it. I know. I don’t care. I am still me, myself. There was a person, who typed “You are so ugly, why are you here？”, “You are so ugly, why are you here？” for the whole night.
Did that hurt your feelings？
At first, yeah. Well, I realized I wasn’t good looking at all, I mean.
But then once you joked on your live streaming show, some followers say that you resemble the Terracotta Warriors.
Yeah. I do like a Terracotta Warrior which is my privilege because…haha… Definitely my privilege.
Yeah. That’s certainly a nice way…
When you see me, you see history, okay？
And finally, Yuhui. If you were to introduce yourself to global audience, who may not be that familiar with you…in a few sentences, what would you say about yourself？
A young man with not very good English, especially my accent and pronunciation and grammatical mistakes. I’m sorry, yeah. You suffered a lot in this interview, thank you.

### 03-01

I’ve had my ups and downs. My fair share of bumpy roads and heavy winds. That’s what made me what I am today. Now I stand here before you.  

What you see is a body crafted to perfection. A pair of legs engineered to defy the laws of physics, and a mind set to master the most epic of splits.

《Hard Target》 

Hi, they told me at the cafe that you **might be** down here.I need to talk to you about something.

I don’t think this is a good time now.

How’d you, um, like to work for me？ I’ll pay you 100 dollars a day. 

For doing what？

For 100 dollars, does it really matter？

Actually, it does. Yeah. It does.

Look, I really need you to help me find someone. You know this city, you obviously can **take care of yourself**.

I would like to help you, darling. Looks like I’m gonna be out of town. Way out of town. Sorry.

——

So, this guy you’re looking for, he owes you money **or something？**

He’s my father.

Okay, I change my mind. I’ll help you for two days, you’ll pay me 217 dollars.

It’s a deal.

You can drive.

I don’t have a driver’s license.

So how did you lose your papa？ 

My parents, um, they got divorced when I was seven and my father…well, he moved away. He started to write and he even called me a couple of times. Three weeks ago the letters just stopped. 

I‘ve got a friend here who can help us. You check the line, I’ll look around inside.

All right, so these are your New Year’s resolutions, you wanna make 100,000 dollars online, you wanna go to the gym and get a six-pack, you wanna meditate every single day, now, do you wanna know what the **truth** actually is.  

Only 9% of you will succeed and if that sounds harsh, good, because I want you to understand **the severity of the situation**. You say that 2024 will be your year, but most likely, it won’t be. Now the question is, why are you still doing it. Frankly, it’s not your fault, here’s why.  

There is a war on your time. Dozens of multi-billion dollar enterprises have all **wage****d war** against you and they won’t stop until they win. They won’t stop until every last second of your time is spent on their platforms.  

My friend, there are no accidents on their apps. Nothing is random, everything is planned and those billions are all spent to get one thing and one thing only. Your attention.  

You have a limited amount of attention and focus to give. You can’t focus on everything, it’s impossible. In fact, a recent research that’s has been published on Science magazine, shows that we spent 46.9% of our days with our minds stayed away from the **very** tasks that we should be doing.  

That is almost half of your day, gone, to what. Simply not being able focus. I mean really think about it, how many times have you gone to just check your phone for a second and the next thing you know you’ve spent hours scrolling on Instagram or TikTok, and you don’t even mean to do it. That is how they control you.  

The average person spends 30% more time on their phone today, that means the average person spends 4 hours and 12 minutes on their phone. I mean, let’s really put that into perspective. In just a few years, your phone has gone from stealing 12% of your entire day in 2019 to over 17.5% today. **If you keep going down this road,** you will spend over a third of your entire life staring at a screen, is this what you wanna become an expert at, do you really wanna be that guy. The guy who sends the best memes, is that what you wanna be known for? We both know the answer to that.  

Now let me ask you a question, what has **material**ly changed to make 2024, the **pivot****al year** of your life. Because let’s face it, every year you tell yourself this is gonna be my year. Yet, it never is. You keep letting yourself down, year after year. Well, in fact, scratch that actually. You don’t just let yourself down, because it’s much worse than that. You’re letting yourself down but you’re also letting down that everyone around you, your family, your friends. I mean, **hell**, even your future bloodline.  

So my question to you now is, are you gonna be a part of the 91% that fail year after year after year or, are you gonna join me in making 2024, your year. This is a decision only you can make.

The film is divided into three narratives. The first narrative centers around the king and queen of a kingdom named Longtrellis. At first, **it seems as if** the couple is living a happy life, but later we get to know that the queen is **suffering from** a rare medical condition, which will never allow her to become a mother. Because of this, the queen is always upset. 

One day he invites some circus performers to the palace. Suddenly, the queen notices that one of the circus performers is expecting a child.  

As a result, she becomes **envious** and starts smashing things after entering her **chamber**. When the king finds out about this, he pays a visit to her room and vows to go to any extent to solve her problem. 

Late at night, a strange *necro***mancer** arrives at the castle, claiming that he can solve the queen’s pregnancy problem 

The king will have to capture a sea monster, whose heart will be used to cure the queen’s illness, then a pure and unmarried lady will prepare it, which will be eaten by the queen. In this way the necromancer assures that the queen will become pregnant. 

The following day, the king sets out on his mission. He finds the creature in one of the rivers. When the monster is sleeping, the king walks into the ocean to attack it.  

He’s eventually successful in slaying the beast, but gets critically injured in the struggle. Soon, he suc**cumb**s to his injuries, but before he does, he removes the creature’s heart. The queen then returns to the castle covering the heart with a cloth. Later, a maid at the castle is found to be unmarried and pure. As a result, she’s **tasked with** preparing the heart.  

While cooking, she experiences strange sensations and 

suddenly becomes pregnant. Soon, the queen consumes the heart and finally she becomes pregnant. In the next scene, the maid and the queen give birth to their children at the same time. The boys look to be the same age. 

The queen’s son is named Elias, whereas the maid’ son is named Jonah. The movie then fast forwards to 16 years where the children have now become adults.  

The queen is living a happy life with her son Elias as she thinks that she’s been given a second chance at life.  

However the two children who were born on the same day and look like twins are not typical children as the sea monster is represented by the white tone of their hair. 

They have a strong friendship and are extremely close to each other. The queen on the other hand despises their friendship. She informs her son that as a prince, he’s not permitted to be friends with the maid’s son Jonah.  

Despite this, Elias **ignores his mother** and continues to meet with Jonah. Later we also get to know that the kids have the capacity to breathe underwater in a unique way.  

In the next scene, the queen threatens her maid that if she doesn’t prevent her son from meeting Elias, she and her kid will be expelled from the country. 

Nonetheless the two seem unconcerned and meet on a regular basis. They **cross the line** one day when Jonah wears Elias’s clothing and goes to the queen.  

When she discovers the truth, she chooses to exile Jonah from the kingdom. Elias makes an attempt to stop him but fails.  

Jonah then cuts off a tree with his knife and water starts to flow from there. He tells Elias that as long as the water is clean, he should know that he’s alive and as soon as it becomes red, he should understand that Jonah’s life is in jeopardy. After saying that, he walks away. 

Elias checks the water regularly to see if it has turned red. One day the water turns red and he realizes that something is wrong. In order to find Jonah, he leaves the kingdom without notifying his mother.

Step one, cleanse thy earthly vessel. Shower, get fresh. Treat yourself with respect. Brush your teeth, wear a scent. And if you fail to take care of yourself on a basic level, you’ll fail outwards in space and time. Being clean and feeling fresh as a ritual, will increase your self-perception over time.  

You’ll be putting your best foot forward and will be signaling to your subconscious that you’re worth taking care of. So even if Yellowstone erupts and the world descends into chaos and destruction, at least you’ll smell good.   

Step two, order the kingdom. Clean your room, deep clean your house. Get rid fo all the shit that scattering your mind. Refuse to live in a monument of filth, like an ever-present reminder of things left undone. Cuz the space you occupy is an extension of yourself. 

And then Venture Forth. When you have your ducks in a row, then get out of the house. Rapunzel stayed in her tower because she was emotionally **manipulated** by a devouring mother, but what about you, the human brain operates best with our feet moving. We’re meant to be in relationship and community with others.   

Step four, sweat. If I told you there was a pill, that was guaranteed to **boost your mental and physical energy** throughout the day.  

Increase your overall mood and outlook on life, improve your mental clarity, prolong your life span and increase your **physical attractiveness**, would you take that pill? But that pill is real and it’s called working out and the top performers in the world take it every day. So get the blood pumping. Go break a sweat. Do it daily, because that which cost energy giveth energy.

I always wanted to study…

You always wanted to study in the United States.

When I can, uh… achieve my dreams.

Dreams, that is your dream. **Do you have any relatives living in the United States?**

Yes. My **uncle** is there.

Where **does** he live in the United States?

They stay in the Chicago.

Are you planning to work in the United States?

No.

What school will you be attending?

Troy University.

What university?

Troy. 

Troy?   

T-R-O-Y. 

That’s pronounced Troy. Where is this university?

It is located in Alabama.

Alabama. What city do you know? What’s the nearest city.

I don’t know. 

You don’t know. Okay, that might be a good thing for you to know the name of the city where Troy is located. Alabama is a very big state. But why Troy, there are many many universities in the United States, why did you choose Troy? 

**How did you hear about** this school?

Beyond Consultancy.

Have you been accepted at Troy？

No.

No, you haven’t been accepted…

I applied it.

You’ve applied.

Yes.

All right. What is your GPA?

Uh, it’s 62.

Say it again.

62. 

Usually, we’ll say something like…three point seven five, three point, two point something. **So you’ll have to explain when you say 62 that you studied in India and that’s how you were graded there, 62** **out of** **100.**

What are your plans after completing your studies in the United States.

I will come back to my place, in Nepal. Where my family is staying here and I wanted to develop my own business here.

**What kind of** business?

I want to develop a restaurant.

Is that what your parents do?

No.

What are your parents doing?

They are doing agriculture.

How do you plan to **fund** your education?

Sorry.

How do you plan to **pay for your education**.

My **sponsor** will be my family and also my uncle, he’s in United States.

**Have you ever been to the United States****？**

No. I never.

Have you **appli**ed for any **scholar**ships or **financial** **aid**?

No.

You haven’t. **It might be a good thing to do**. Once you’re accepted by Tory University. You might ask them, are there any scholarships **available** to **foreign students.**

Can you provide any documentation to support your application to Troy.

Yes, I already did. 

So you have already applied the choice. You sent them your tran**script**s and your **test score**s, and your **financial statements.** 

It’s very important that the embassy knows if you are going to be fully funded from someone, either here or by the scholarship in Tory. 

It’s important to that you are capable of explaining why you want to go to Troy University. You know, you just can’t look at all the universities in the United States and think, oh I think I’ll go to this one. You have to know why you’re going to Troy **rather than** why you’re not **trying at** UCLA or at Pepperdine or at **New York State**. What is there about Troy that interests you. You must know, if Troy is the University that you want to study, where you want to study. They have an **art program**, many universities have art programs, but some art programs are better than other art programs. So I don’t anything about Troy University myself. So I don’t know if they have a good **art department** or not. So you’ll have to explain that to someone who’s interviewing you at the embassy, okay?

Okay.

It’s nice meeting you.

Thank you.

I think you’ll do well. A little more practice and you’ll do well.  

God bless you, **get well** from your **not feeling well**.

Do you often have headaches?

Yes. Two days ago.

Do you have a **fever**？

Yes.

A fever? **You should go home and go to bed**. All right, goodbye.

I think if you have a disability, you should be proud, because you’re not like **anyone else**. You’re unique. That’s what’s personal to you.  

Hi, my name is **Tilly** and I’m the first **teenager** in the UK to get bionic arms. So the arms are controlled by my **muscle** **sensor****s** and the sensors are on the inside. So whatever I do with my muscles, I can control the fingers. So if I squeeze my muscles they’ll close, then I’ll flex they’ll open. And then I have four different grip modes, which makes it a lot easier to do... holds different types of things.  

When I was first born, I was just like any normal baby completely happy, healthy. But when I was 15 months old, I fell really ill. I was originally diagnosed with an ear infection and **sent home**. But it just really escalated from there. 

“There was something in the back of my mind. **That was like saying** is it just an ear infection, **though**? And it wasn’t until later on. When I went to change her nappy, we noticed the … I say they look like bruise like **marks**,”  

I actually started getting into makeup **and stuff**. It was a bit difficult at first, because I haven’t got any memories to look back on how I would hold **certain objects**.  

When I first started putting make up tutorials on YouTube, people thought it was really impressive and wanted to see more of like how I did it.  

“Hi you all, it’s Tilly and welcome back to my Youtube channel.  

“Lzzy, would you like glam today or natural.” 

I like to use my arm as a beauty **blend**er sometimes.  

I think social media is ,plays a really big part because I’ve got quite a big following on that. I’ve been posting **all the stuff** about it and like **promoting** and showing everyone how cool they can be. 

It just makes me feel really, really confident. Because in the past, people would look at me, and I would be **bothered.** I found my bionic hands, get a lot of stares, but in a more positive way. Like people are now looking at them with **amazement** and smiles on their faces, rather than, a sad, and **feeling sorry for** me.  

These hands have been made by **Open Bionics** in five years, and if this is what they can **achieve** in five, just think of what they can achieve in another five. So I’m really excited about the future.

Bob was **in his element** in the **mukbang**. He was a competitive eater when he was 25.

Here’s a **quick tutorial** on how to be miserable for the rest of your life.  

Stop one, wake up whenever you want to. Don’t wake up at a reasonable hour, an hour that makes you **feel good** about yourself. Make sure you wake up when everyone has **had a** **head start** to the day. You really wanna make sure you feel like you’ve **missed any chance** to start your day off on the right foot. When you get out of bed, don’t **make your bed** and don’t shower. Just wear whatever you **wore** yesterday and head downstairs. It’s important that you start the day off with **little to no** self-respect, feeling as grimy as possible.  

Step two, make sure your house is always a **complete disaster**. Your house is **filled with** many rooms, each with a specific purpose. You wanna **make sure** that it’s extremely difficult to **accomplish those purposes**. The pigsty will also help subconsciously reinforce the idea that you’re a **disorganized person** whose life is **not in order**.  

Step three, **procrastinate**. When the thought dawns on you to do **something productive**, like clean your disgusting kitchen, just ignore that feeling.  

Step four, **look busy.** After you sit down to do some work, **open up a Word document** to help yourself feel like you’re being productive. Give your document a nice title, and then immediately **open up** Reddit, instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, **just to check if you missed anything**.  

Step five, **wait for opportunities**. Never be proactive with finding new opportunities to grow your career or **meet new people**. Wait for all of that to come knocking on your door.  

Step six, be **default** no. When a friend asks you to go out for a drink, just say no. When your boss gives you the opportunity to lead a meeting at work, try to find an excuse to **slink out** of it.    

Step seven, be suspicious of people. Never give people the benefit of the doubt. **Assume** the smiles people give you are fake, **and that** their motives are **male****volent**.  

Step eight, never **fix the things** you dislike about yourself. Continue to engage in activities that make you feel **sub****human** and **weak.** Never attempt to **transcend** your vices.  

Step nine, focus on things you can’t control. As often as possible, get **pissed off** at the traffic, **the government**, the pandemic. You really wanna reinforce the idea that the world is **messed up**. Focus on the shortcomings of others. Maintain a constant external locus of control over all the events in your life.  

Step ten, **use fear as motivation**. Make the fear of negative consequence. Your primary motivator for everything you do. Use **white-****knuckle** **tactics** to force yourself into productivity.

“It was terrible to see. ” 

Police launched an investigation into the **abuse** **allegations** and **Jordan** **Chandler**’s family announced they were preparing a **civil case**.  

But despite her strong suspicions to the contrary in a sworn **deposition**, Adrian McManus said she had never witnessed Jackson molest children. 

 “I was scared to say anything bad about Michael. Mr. Jackson.” 

“There have been many **disgusting statements** made recently *concerning* **allegation**s of im**proper** conduct on my part. These statements about me are totally **false**. Don’t treat me like a criminal, cuz I am innocent.”

 “I remember that, I was working there when that day when that media was taping that.”

“1993. Don’t treat me like a criminal because I’m innocent.” 

Australian choreo*grapher* Wade Robson has claimed he was molested by the singer when he was a boy. 

“He told me, if they ever found out what we were doing, He and I would go to jail **for the rest of our lives**.” 

“Hello, Wade. Today is your birthday. So, congratulations. I love you. Goodbye.”

Michael Jackson had just **dangle**d his new baby out of the window of a Berlin hotel. Michael Jackson hoped the **documentary** would **turn** his reputation **around**, instead, it destroyed it.

“Have you been hearing about what people have been saying?” 

“That’s totally **ignorant**. I would never do that to my children or any child trying to kill them. Come on. Stupid.”

“I think Mr. Bashir turned it all against him. Tried to create a **sensationalist** documentary for **personal** **gain**, that’s my opinion and it was spliced together and put together in a way, which **in my opinion** was designed to make Michael look bad. ” 

Young boys like **Home Alone** actor **Macaulay Culkin** who she claims she saw **being touched inappropriately** by the singer.

Do you **stand** **by** that story? 

“I stand by what I said during my **de**position, I think it’s best just **leave it at that**.”

“Because Macaulay Culkin says, it’s pre**poster**ous, doesn’t he? He denies it to this day.”

“He does”. 

Macaulay Culkin has always supported Michael Jackson and denies the singer **ever** molested him.

An Apopka man shot and killed protecting his girlfriend while visiting a state park in Alabama. 

Deputies there say the **couple** was robbed at gunpoint and then the shooting. Fox 35 **Stephanie Buffamonte** spoke with the girlfriend today.  

His girlfriend wasn’t ready to speak on camera but I talked with her outside of her house today and it was truly just **heartbreaking**. This is such a sad story and she describes her boyfriend as her hero who died to protect her life. 

Mikayla Paulus is heartbroken. She shared this video of the **simple sweet** and **silly moments** of her and the love of her life **Adam Simjee**. She says this is a photo of them just **one hour before** they were **held at gunpoint** Sunday morning at **Cheaha State Park** in Alabama. Adam was shot and killed.  

Mikayla tells me they’ve been together for four years and love hiking. They were on a trip just before the two **UCF** students were supposed to return to **campus** Monday. Mikayla tells me while hiking they saw someone waving their hands on our **National Forest Service** road at the park. Claiming they had car trouble.  

She said they **went over** to try to help fix the car but then the woman turned on them. Pulling out a gun and started **asking for money** and their bank account numbers. 

Mikayla says the woman shot Adam in the **stomach area** and Adam shot that woman in the **leg**, hurting her **badly**. She said Adam had a gun in his **waist**band tha**t he took while they were hiking**. Mikayla says Adam **stopped** the gunman from hurting her, saving her life. 

This is a picture of another woman **accused of being involved in** the robbery.  

She ran off after the shooting but has **since been** arrested by the sheriff’s office in Alabama. The shooter survived and was airlifted to the hospital. 

Mikayla tells me she took off her **shirt** and was holding it against his stomach to try to stop the bleeding but said, it **took a little bit** for **paramedics** to get there because they were deep in the woods. And it was just too late.

**What does it** **take** **for** a regular guy like me to become a real **race car driver**. 

No, I’m not talking about **renting a supercar** and driving it on a **private** **track**. I’m talking about the **real deal**, **wheel to wheel** race car driving on a **proper circuit**. I wanted to do this **ever since** I was a **little boy**, today I’m gonna show you **how I did it** and **how you could do it** too. How hard could it be？ 

“Hello, **I’m looking to** become a professional race car driver. ”

“Ah, sounds great, do you got a million dollars? ” 

The bit problem is **we’ve heard it a million times**, if you want to be a **professional race car driver** you basically have to be a **gazillion****aire**. It’s a story as old as time.  

Now **first step** in becoming a race car driver is getting your **racing license** and getting a racing license **involves a lot of paperwork**. You gotta join the **sanctioning body** for the race series. You gotta **submit a photo****copy** of your driver’s license. You gotta **get a physical** by a doctor. 

“Hey ,okay, you can race.” 

**All of that stuff** is gonna cost you **somewhere in the** **ballpark** for about **a thousand dollars**.

I've missed the warmth of Taiwanese people. I’ve missed the food, like “夜市”. I love. I’m a **big** night market **fan**. Hi, everyone, my name is Oceana. 我叫小海。 

And I am from the States, and I’m currently back in Taiwan. I’ve been back here for almost 2 years now. My dad is American, my mom’s Tawanese, so I’m mixed racially. And I was born in the States, I grew up there until about 9 years old, and then I moved to Taiwan when I was 9. So I did study **elementary** **school** here. And then I **went back** to the States for high school and university. Right now, I’m studying performing arts. I do like acting and stuff like that. **Other than** my school, I’m also doing... you know, like, I film ads, like advertisements **and stuff like that**. Recently I also **competed in** Miss Taiwan. The pageant, 台湾小姐.  

And so I’m **going to be** representing Taiwan at the **Miss international competition**.  

Actually, when I first moved to Taiwan, **it was because** my grandfather **on my mother’s side**. He was ill, and my mom, she’s **the eldest** in her family, so she wanted to come back to… kind of… you know, take care of her family.

“Very Taiwanese” 

Yeah, very Taiwanese. She had the responsibility. And... so, **but at the same time**, she also wanted me to, you know, get exposed to a half of me, like, I was never really exposed to Taiwanese culture when I was younger.  

And so she thought it was a **great opportunity** for me to get exposed to... you know, **part of me**.

For starters, what should I call you? 

I’m Chloe, and you? What’s your name? 

Oh, John, my name is John.  

**Delighted to meet you**, John. 

Could you tell us a little about yourself and what you can do, Chloe. 

Of course, I’m the first **personal** **assist**ant built by **Cyber Life**.  

I take care of most everyday tasks like cooking, housework or **managing your** 

**appointments** for example. 

Hmm, and I understand you’re the first Android to have passed the Turing **test**. Could you tell us a little more about that?  

I really didn't do much, you know, I just spoke with a few humans to see if they could **tell the difference** between me and a real person, **it was a really interesting experience**.  

But this is the first time in history that man has created a machine more intelligent than himself. I gather your brain can perform several billion billion operations per second. Is that right?  

Absolutely, but I only exist **thanks to** the intelligence of the humans who designed me. You know, they have something I could never have. Really? And what’s that?  

A soul.

I enjoy cooking pancakes and scrambled eggs. Their favorite. I make sure everyone has a nutritious and delicious meal to **start their day**.  

After breakfast, I help my **children** **get ready for school**. I assist them in **getting dressed** and making sure they have everything they need for their day ahead.  

Once they are off to school. I tidy up the house, doing some cleaning and organizing. Keeping our home **clean and cozy** is **essential** to me. Around mid morning, I **head to** the grocery store. I carefully **pick** 

**out** fresh fruits, vegetables and other essentials for the week. I enjoy planning meals and making sure we have everything we need.  

Back home I **unpack the groceries** and start preparing lunch. I try to make something **healthy** and **balanced f**or my family.  

While the food is cooking, I take a moment to water my plants. And **tend to** my small garden. I love seeing the plants grow. It’s so fulfilling.  

After lunch, I help my kids with their homework. It’s a great opportunity to bond and help them understand their lessons better. We often have fun **studying together**. Once they finish their homework. We spend some time **playing games** or **doing creative activities.**  

In the late afternoon, I start **preparing dinner**. I enjoy trying new recipes. And experimenting in the kitchen. Cooking is like an art for me. I love combining different ingredients and creating tasty meals for my family to enjoy together.  

Evenings are for **family time**. We **sit together** share stories about our day and enjoy dinner. Sometimes we **watch a movie** or read books before bedtime.  

I make sure my children are **ready for bed**. Tucked in and feeling loved before they **doze** off.  

Once everyone is asleep. I take a moment to relax. I reflect **on the day**. And think about what tomorrow might bring. Being a homemaker may seem like a lot of work. But the joy of seeing my family happy, and cared for **makes it** **all** **worth it**.

Tokyo is a sound sleeper but awakens early in the morning. Super **ex**press *train*s on the new Tokaido line **prepare for** a busy day.  

Tokyo’s largest wholesale market supplies **every kind of** food imaginable to satisfy the appetites of the city’s 11 million people. Fish comes from all the seven seas, more than 2,000 tons of it daily. 

Early morning in the suburbs is a time of departures. University students are already on the campus. Workers hurry to their jobs. Many of Tokyo’s white-collar workers work in the central business district. Between eight and nine a.m., several million people pour into the city.  

Later in the morning, Tokyo’s fashionable **department stores** awaken after a beauty rest.   

Luxury goods of **all kinds** and in all price ranges, sell rapidly in Tokyo shops. Many varieties of fine quality products are available at reasonable prices.  

The people of Tokyo cherish their leisure and **spend it well**. They yearn for a touch of nature.  

Ikebana or **flower arrangement** is a traditional art that lends itself to the creation of a **time****less** **beauty**. The heart of a woman and the **de****li****c****ate** **touch** of her hand do not change from age to age.  

Old customs are preserved in the daily life of Tokyo’s people. 

Here we see the festival of **Shichigo-San** when parents pray for the welfare of their children who are seven, five or three years old.  

Festivals are also occasions for **getting to know** **one**’s neighbors better, and bringing older and younger generations closer together.  

Before midnight Tokyo quiets down and peace steals over the city. Sleep well, Tokyo, and slumber as long as you can. For there is another long busy day ahead.

This is a city mouse. He lives in a **big city** with **tall buildings** and lots of shops and restaurants. But today he is visiting his friend, a **country mouse**.  

The country mouse lives in a cozy nest at the bottom of a tree. Her home is small ,but it is warm and comfortable.  

The country mouse cooks a dinner of food from her garden. Corn, carrots, acorns, and a cold glass of water from the stream.  

Meanwhile, the city mouse talks and talks. 

“The city is **amazing**! I go to the theater and the **museum**. My house has twenty rooms. **You absolutely must visit**! Have you ever tried Chinese food?”  

That night, the country mouse dreams that she lives in the city. She dreams that she eats at fancy restaurants, says fancy things, and buys fancy hats from fancy stores. She dreams about eating Chinese food.  

“**How wonderful!**” She thinks. “I want to live in the city too!” 

The next morning, the **country mouse** agrees to visit the city mouse. She **pack****s her bag** and follows the city mouse back to his **big house** in the city.  

The house is enormous! There are twenty rooms **full of** beautiful furniture. The country mouse is amazed. 

“**Which room is mine?**” She asks.  

“Um… we actually live down here…” says the city mouse. 

He leads her down some stairs to the basement. In the darkness, the country mouse sees many families of mice. 

“These are my housemates…” explains the city mouse.  

The city mouse leads the country mouse back upstairs for dinner. In the **dining room**, there is a feast of delicious foods on the table. Cheese, bread, cookies, cakes, and lemonade. There is also… Chinese food!  

But just as they start to eat, crash! A cat with sharp teeth and sharp claws jumps up on the table.  

The **city cat** chases the two mice off the table and across the floor. The mice hide in a hole in the wall. They are trapped! They wait silently until the cat leaves. Then, they quietly creep back to the dinning room.  

But all the food is gone! The city humans ate everything! The country mouse hurries back to the basement and packs her bag. 

“Where are you going?” Asks the city mouse.  

“Home.” She says. “I want to go back to the country. Your city life isn’t so wonderful after all. Now, please, help me call a taxi.” 

Moral: Sometimes other people’s lives are not as great as they make you believe.

It can happen fast. A car crashes into water, quickly sinking. A recent victim is the sister-in-law of Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, billionaire 

businesswoman Angela Chao, who lost her life after backing her Tesla into a pond.  

Dr. Gordon Giesbrecht is an expert on car submersions. In this demonstration, you can see Giesbrecht deliberately drive a car into a lake. The car fills with water. Giesbrecht makes his way to the **back seat**. Big mistake, he says.  

“You need to get out of that vehicle **as quick as possible**. You’ve got about one minute to **finish everything**. We advise S.W.O.C., Seatbelts off, windows open, out immediately, children first.”

Another tip, avoid the **natural instinct** of calling 911, because you’ll lose critical time.  

“If you grab your **cell phone**, basically you’re gonna die.” 

In another demonstration, Giesbrecht and his team show how to get out correctly. They get their seat belts off, open the windows, and escape the sinking vehicle.  

“Your car is basically a boat with a big leak, and the windows will stay above the water for, you know, 30, 40, 60 seconds. Your electric windows will certainly work for 30 to 60 seconds. ” 

Could Angela Chao have saved herself if she had a hammer or glass breaker? Could she have broken the windows of her Tesla and gotten out like this demonstration?  

“The lamination is designed to keep shards from flying **all over the place** to keep the glass as whole as possible. So you go to hit this, it’s not going to break.”

“Citizen, we are under attack from northern invaders.” 

The story of Mulan, her journey from village girl to soldier to warrior and hero is very very real to people, so it’s such an honor to bring her to life in a new way. 

“Every family must contribute one man to fight. 

The story of Mulan is inspiring to everybody. It opens up people's imagination. 

“I am blessed with two daughters, I will fight.”  

“You’re a war hero, you’ve already made many great sacrifices.” 

“My father cannot fight, so I will take his place.” 

The original Ballad of Mulan was written in the 7th century and it’s been told countless times. I love the animated version, it’s thrilling to take some of the beloved sequences and make them happen in the real world. 

“Their leader calls himself Bori Khan.” 

We have two new characters, our villains, Bori Khan and Xianniang.  

“You will die pretending to be something you’re not”

“Yet here I stand proof that there is a place for people like us.”  

“When we take the imperial city, I will **take revenge** for my father.” 

They’re putting every ounce of effort to **get things right**.  

Every department did deep research to bring the best version of this legendary story to life. 

“You will now take the oath of the warrior.”

“Loyal, brave！”

“Release!”

“Just my duty to protect my family.”  

Mulan means so much because of who she is. She’s not a superhero, she’s human. 

She’s unique, she can do unbelievable things and love is really the *fuel* for everything.   

“When they find out who you are, they will show you no mercy.”

◼ Are you working or studying **right now**? 

I am actually a graduate student right now. Studying English literature. 

◼ What do you like about your hometown? 

I like that it’s less crowded, compared to Seoul, because I... sometimes work in Seoul, I sometimes...uh, I go to school in Seoul, so I know how crowded Seoul can be, but when I go home, it’s a lot more relaxing.  

I have a very big park in front of my apartment building, so it’s a lot calmer.  

◼ And can you tell me about some of your hobbies, what do you do in your free time? 

I usually lie down in bed and play games on my phone. I like to joke that I’m an in*vertebrate* because I lie down like a *spine*less animal, but, yeah **that’s my favorite thing to do**, just play games on my phone. Have a podcast playing in the background, and that’s about it. 

◼ What kind of people are popular at work？

At work... For Koreans, I think people who are really good at drinking and love alcohol are usually very popular. I wanted to say that people who do their jobs really well would be popular, but I think that’s not always the case.  

So yeah, people who are outgoing and are always willing to go for a drink afterwards are very popular. 

◼ What benefits are there when a child is popular at school？ 

I think they would get a lot of valentines or gifts, they would have a lot of friends wanting to come to their birthday parties.    

◎ And are there any personality characteristics that people usually find it difficult to **get** along **with** other people? 

It depends on people, but I might say like introvert people is a bit more hard to get along, because since they love staying by themselves. 

◎ What is a piece of advice that older people can give younger people, what kind of advice? 

I got from my dad that don’t be afraid and just try it.  

That really helped me move forward, because we tend to get afraid of something very easily because we haven’t tried it yet. But my dad was like, don’t think about it. Like how scary it is, everyone got fear, you just gotta keep that fear in your mind and then move forward and that really helped me.

Dragon Ball was first serialized 40 years ago, it became a huge hit worldwide, spawning cartoons, films and video games.  

The series features a boy who collects magical balls containing dragons to defend the world from evil enemies.  

The studio said he was working on several projects when he died. 

“And it’s all because we don’t have a car”

“Chi-chi, I’d drive you if I could, but you know I don’t have a driver’s license yet.” 

“Well, it’s time you got one.”

“Ah, Chi-chi, do we have to?” 

“Listen, all I’m asking you two to do is get your driver’s license, it’s not like I’m asking you to save the world. And if you don’t, you’ll have to cook your own meals from now on, understand?” 

“Akira Toriyama has passed away at 68. When I needed to find strength within myself and I would look to these characters he created. You know, really found a lot of myself in them. All throughout points of my life.”

Fifth floor 

The juice is just dripping down. 

By the way, this is the first time, I think three months that we’ve put trousers and jackets on. It’s such a weird feeling to not be sweating and *boil*ing hot. But this square is just absolutely incredible, it’s so big. 

Oh, my **gosh****,** guys. So this is Tom.

“Hi, there!”

The owner of this hostel. He is showing us the other rooms right now, and look at this! 

“Hello! Hello!”

“Tom, what *did* you do here?” 

“Oh, I tell my customer, I have three beautiful room. And this one, it’s my favorite room. I like the butterfly. I like nature, you know? So this idea is from the nature. Countryside.”

“Tom actually designed this **entire wall.** Which is like… this is like a fantasy!” 

“How much does it cost?”

“One sixty.”

“One sixty RMB and you get this dream room here in Lijiang.” 

“And I have some pandas. You know, and Big or small.” 

This is truly one of the most beautiful places I have ever been, guys.   

This is *nut*s, guys. It’s about midday and I think all the tour groups have arrived, like this is… this is something else. As much as China maybe wants more international tourists. I don’t think they need them, like, I think they got more than enough of their **own people** to keep all of their *attract*ions very very busy. 

I’m losing speed, guys. It’s like three o’clock right now. And I’m... I got up at five this morning to like… get ready **and then** drive to the entry of the park which is like forty minutes away from downtown, Zhangjiajie. 

I don’t know what I got exactly, but, funny enough, it kind of looks like Pelmeni, right? Like a Russian kind of dumplings.  

I feel like many Asian and European cultures have dumpling, so let’s give these guys a try.  

That was unfortunate, it’s so hot.

Now in the 21st century, marriage is no longer a necessity, but rather an option, and many women choose to remain single.  

Yet, there is not enough social security for them, creating a blind spot of the structural system.  

Jeong Eun-mi is a 41 year-old florist who dreamed of becoming a good wife and wise mother as a child.  

Like the majority of people, she thought she had to get married and form a family when she was younger. But her per*spec*tive has changed a lot. 

“I gained a genuine passion and desire for my career in my early 30’s. Therefore, I naturally focused more on my work than romantic relationships, and time passed very quickly.”  

“Marriage is not only a *union* of two lovers but of families, which I found very burdensome. I wasn’t sure if I could take care of all the things that occur in my husband’s family while pursuing my career.” 

Jeong Eun is not the only one who chooses to remain unmarried. Many women in their 30’s and 40’s do too.  

39 year old Kim Hyun-joo, works for the **co****operative society** of an animal hospital in Seoul. 

And she mentioned that Korean single women are stuck in the blind spot of social welfare.    

More than anything, the biggest fear comes from the fact that there are many structural limits if they suffer from any diseases.  

“If I needed medical surgery, only my direct family members are eligible to sign the consent form. I currently live with my friend, who is single as well, but she would not be eligible to sign the form even if my life depended on it.”   

As a cat owner, Kim formed a gathering of *fellow* single women with animal companions.  

The best thing about this gathering is that they have good neighbors to rely on in times of emergency, who also have the same interest and concerns.  

“There are certain hardships we experience because we chose to remain unmarried. We share those things, relate to one another and get healed along the way.”  

Outside the welfare system, single women have to find their own **means** to secure their futures, and they’re calling on a change in the family-centered social policies.

Hello. My name is Alex. And if you want to learn about and improve your English pronunciation. You’ve come to the right place.  

There’re videos, quizzes, activities and downloads to help you practice your English. Well, you don’t have to speak English like a native speaker. It’s fine to have a different accent. There are many different English accents in Britain and all around the world. These’re all good models. Now, my accent is standard southern British English and that’s what I’ll be showing you on this site.  

All guns and no *ball*s, right, Billy boy? 

So what do we do now? Just give the order. 

It doesn’t have to be like this, Kimber. 

It’s too late for all that. You’ve **bit off** more than you can chew, you little toerag, and now I’m going to take over this shithole. 

Well, if we have to use guns, let’s use proper guns!  

**Sergeant** Thorne reporting for duty, **sir.** 

Let me tell you something, **me and you**, one on one, **no one else around**. I will beat your ass like a Cherokee drum. 

Maybe one day we’ll find out. 

Oh, you better hope that day never comes. 

I am Eddie Redmayne, and these random objects that you see in front of me are ten essential items in my life. 

To play in a **charity** **t***ennis match*, you either have to be really good or very funny. And I had neither of those attributes, and it was pretty horrendous.

One day, Karen’s mother got very sick. So Karen went to town to buy medicine for her mother, and along the way, she found a pair of red shoes in a box on the roadside. 

The shoes shone so beautifully that Karen couldn’t help but bring them home with her.  

“Look mommy, I found these by the roadside, aren’t they beautiful, **just right for me**. ” 

“These may belong to someone else, Karen, you should immediately take them back. ”

“But if they had an owner, she wouldn’t have left them there with the box. ”

“Maybe the owner dropped it accidentally. ”

“Then they shouldn’t have dropped it. I found them, they belong to me now. They’re mine. ” 

The next day, on her way to her mother’s funeral. Karen put on those red shoes. Those who came to the funeral couldn’t take their eyes off Karen’s shoes. 

“How dare she wear red shoes on a funeral.”

“So dis*respectful*.”

But Karen did not care, because she loved her shoes. 

A good-hearted old woman **passed by** the cemetery. This old woman learned that this little girl was now an orphan and wanted to adopt her. 

So Karen went to live with the old woman for many years. 

“Karen, you’ve been wearing these shoes since your mother’s funeral. You need to take them off now. They’re so dirty.”

“No, I love my red shoes.”

“Oh, Karen, don’t be so stubborn.” 

And the old woman brought her a new pair of shoes. But Karen didn’t like these shoes at all. 

“But these are blue. Very ugly.” 

So for years to come, Karen missed her red shoes a lot. She grew into a beautiful young lady, but her **stubborn attitude** never changed. 

“Oh, look, just like my favorite red shoes. I must have them. Let’s *get* these.”

“Karen, you don’t need fancy red shoes.” 

One day, the old woman told Karen that they needed to attend a funeral in town. 

“Karen, be sure to put on your black shoes. Otherwise, it will be disrespectful at the funeral.” 

“You didn’t listen to what I told you and you put on the red shoes again. Show some respect.” 

A handsome young lord passing by at that time was struck by Karen’s beauty.

“How beautiful you are and so delicate in these beautiful shoes.”

“Uh, my lord, you make me b*lush*.”

“You must be a very good dancer, I invite you to the dance night in the palace tonight. Please come.” 

With the happiness of the lord’s **offer**. Karen started dancing with joy.

But after a while, Karen couldn’t stop dancing.

“Why can’t I stop my **f****ee****t**. What is happening.” 

After Karen gave up her stubbornness. Things started to get better. 

One day, **someone knocked on the door**, it was the young and handsome lord.

“Well, there you are, Karen. I tried to keep up but you danced so fast, how did you do that?”

Karen was glad to see the handsome and young lord.  

That was the day the lord and Karen’s love began. Leaving stubbornness behind, Karen lived a happy and peaceful life.

When someone listens to you and makes you feel  special. How could you suspect that they have something else in mind.  

When I felt lonely, he was there for me. 

When I couldn’t talk to my parents. I could talk to him. When I felt worthless, he made me feel appreciated.  

He understood me, so when should I have seen it coming.  

I babysat my niece and nephew during the week, being at their house was like a vacation from mine. And Steve, well uncle Steve, was like my adult best friend.  

“Mary’s got the kids, let’s…let’s go for a drive.” 

He’d take me out so I could talk about my school stress or my issues with friends, or my fights with my family and he’d find a way to make me laugh.  

“Hey, when your mom acts like a lawyer, you can plead the fifth. It’ll hold up in court, trust me.”  

Besides the babysitting money. Sometimes there’d be a gift. Should that have made me cautious? 

“Whoa, I wanted this exact one.”

“Yeah, I saw you *post* about it online.” 

I remember when he asked me if I was dating anybody yet. 

“Well, why not？”

“Cuz guys don’t look at me.”

“All guys look a cute girl with **curves**, gets all the attention.” 

He talked about sex a lot and my body.

“Show what they want to see.” 

It was weird, but he made me feel more confident in myself.  

When I realized that my relationship with my uncle wasn’t normal. I thought it was too late. 

“Why don’t we go down to the beach…have some fun.”

“My mom’s expecting me home.”

“We don’t have to be long.”

“She’d noticed she’d blow up again we just stopped fighting.”

“Oh, *you’re no fun*.”

It’s so easy to spot when it’s happening to someone else. All the teasing and sex talk and gifts and touching, I didn’t want to get him in trouble, I just wanted things to be normal again.  

I spent months thinking I would keep it a secret forever, but I couldn’t hide from my uncle. So I stopped babysitting my cousins and answering his calls. So, I did the only thing I could think of. 

“Mom, could we talk?”

“Yeah, honey. Sure.” 

Now I understand that abuse can come from anyone, even a close relative. Sure, my uncle showed me affection, gave me gifts and allowed me to confide in him. But lots of relatives do that stuff and it’s totally fine. So when did it go too far? The moment I felt uncomfortable.  

Pay attention to how others make you feel. When you realize something’s wrong. That’s when you have to say no. And do whatever you can to be safe. Don’t get **caught up** thinking about *what might happen* if you tell someone. You have to do what’s best for you. Sometimes that means getting help from an adult you trust. Listen, no matter what the circumstance or how long it’s been happening. It’s never too late to stop it.

When it comes to **exploring new places** as tourists, most of us **seek adventure**, but few expect their hearts to race with fear.  

This swing on China won a Guinness World Record *for being* the most **spine-tingling** swing on the planet, and it’s not hard to see why. 

If you look down while on the swing, you would see a **massive** 2200 foot drop, but considering you’re moving at 80 miles per hour it’s probably hard to see. 

Mount Huashan. Th**e plank walk** on China’s Mount Hua is considered by many as one of the most dangerous hikes in the world.  

Hikers walk across a few planks of wood **bolted into** the side of a 7000-foot **peak** to reach a small **shrine**. While the hikers are harnessed, it is still a terrifying adventure to many who dare.  

The amazing fact is this dangerous tourist attraction is considered one of China’s five **sacred** **mountains** and is one of the most popular tourist attractions and pilgrimage sites for Chinese people. 

Time to shower! 

The bathroom was trippy. Then I encountered the most friendly toilet **of all**. When I entered the **s****tall**, it opened its mouth and greeted me with blue light.  

Check out this **hall****way** of two-**stor****y** pods. Each pod was marked with a number, incidentally making the floor look like a ruler. 

The **slipper**s camouflage with the floor, let’s tidy them up so they don’t **get confused** with a neighbor’s. 

**“****How did you enjoy your sleep?”**

“It was good, but it was hot.”

**“Yeah, it was hot.****”**

“It felt **stuff**y.”

Once upon a time, Arya, the most beautiful mermaid in the world of the oceans, and her dear *prince* Edward, got on a cruise ship, and sailed to **far away seas**.  

“My prince, I could just sail with you in this beautiful ocean for the rest of my life.” 

Edward and Arya picked tropical fruits from every island they visited. pineapple, mango, coconut, papaya, raspberry, banana, lemons and more. 

“My princess, we haven’t seen any fish in the ocean for days. I wonder why.”

“Yes, I noticed. My friend dolphin has not been around for a few days.” 

“My prince, if I don’t come back by sunset. There is definitely something dangerous going on underwater.” 

And the water, the magnificent deep sea kingdom, and the whole *shim*mering blue sea, looked *calm* and empty. 

The little mermaid Arya swam towards a sea*shell* in the sand. Seashells magically recorded every sound and every wave in the underwater world, just like a diary. 

Arya put the seashell to her ear and started to listen to the things that had happened. 

“It was a bright and fun day in our underwater home. Colorful fish, dolphins, *jelly*fish were active and cheerful as the sunlight *filter*ed through the water *onto* the sea floor. The evil witch Vega and her assistant snake came. I heard them making plans to steal the kingdom’s treasure so that Vega could establish her own kingdom. ”

Chickens are the most populous bird on the planet. There are 23 billion of them at any given time. That’s 10 times more than any other bird.  

“It’s an astonishing achievement for a bird that originated as a small, wild, jungle bird in South East Asia. ” 

It's by far the fastest growing **meat product**, but pound for pound, the price of chicken has fallen sharply. How has this happened？ 

This farm is at the *fore*front of a technology revolution that has drastically changed chicken farming.  

It’s run by David Speller, who’s pioneered the use of CCTV and CO2 monitors in chicken sheds.  

Along with his own farm, he works as a consultant overseeing the raising of around three million chickens in the UK.   

“You can’t get away from the scale, there are 45000 birds in this barn.” 

The success of the contest proves conclusively that it is possible to breed chickens with superior meat-type characteristics.  

*Free range birds* have more access to *open air runs*, while organic chickens are typically free from antibiotics, hormones, and other synthetic chemicals.  

Organic chickens get to live the longest. 81 days compared to intensively reared birds, which live between 35 and 40 days. Free range chickens get the most access to open air runs.  

But when it comes to living space, organic and free range fair far better than intensively reared birds where as many as 17 adult birds live in a single square meter.  

Organic farming might offer animals a greater quality of life, but consumers are largely driven by cost.  

And in an average UK supermarket, an intensively reared chicken costs several times less than its free range or organic cousins.  

Over 95% of broiler chickens are intensively reared in the UK.  

Organic and free range chickens make up the rest. 

“So what’s key for me in being a farmer of chicken is to understand what consumer wants to buy. We are purely market driven.” 

For as long as shoppers want cheap and plentiful chicken, they will continue to be bred *ever*more intensively.

And my sister, she not only mastered advanced Mandarin, she took classical Chinese, she took a couple of years of Mongolian, and she went on and threw in a little Tibetan just for fun. I did not make that up.  

My sister could not have become a dancer as I did later in life, but she is today a professor of East Asian diplomatic history. 

I was six years old when I **received** my first **compliment** for my language skills. I was riding a public bus, in Taipei, Taiwan, with my family, and my sister and I were chattering away. **Across the** **aisle** **from us**, were three elderly Chinese ladies **staring at** us. And my mother overheard them say, in Mandarin, “Oh, those two little girls, **they must be so smart**. They speak such good English.” 

They had no way of knowing, this was the only language that we spoke. And we were too young to be embarrassed. I had plenty of time later in life to be embarrassed. With my Chinese face, I often get this question: Do you speak any Chinese? Every time I have to answer no, it’s a pang of kind of **incompetence** and guilt. But it’s **technically** not my fault.  

My mother grew up in Shanghai, and she grew up speaking Shanghai dialect, which is 

incomprehensible to Mandarin speakers. She only learned Mandarin and English in high school. My father grew up in **Corona**, Queens.  

So, he grew up speaking Taishan village dialect at home with his parents, and a little bit of Cantonese **for** when they went and visited Chinatown. 

But mostly English, he learned it in public school, and he practiced it with customers, across the counter of my grandfather’s hand laundry.  

So my mother speaking Shanghai and Mandarin, and my father speaking Taishan and Cantonese, had no dialect in common. 

I am an American-born person. I have my own version of my Chinese heritage, and it doesn’t have to include memorizing more than two dozen vocabulary words.

Hello friends, it’s Sasha here and today I’m going to be discussing a topic that might be interesting to many of you and it’s why I left the USA. 
I just want to preface this by saying I don’t hate the USA. I don’t want to say that it’s a bad country. 
There’s many wonderful things about the United States, but these are just some of my personal reasons why I just choose not to live there anymore. 
For those of you who don’t know , I was actually born in Hong Kong and I spent most of my childhood there. Hong Kong is a very international and diverse city. All of my classmates in elementary school were from all types of countries. We were very very international. 
So coming from a place like Hong Kong and moving to a very small town in the United States was a major culture shock for me. And I lived in the US for most of my life, ten years, to be exact. 
And even when I went to elementary school, one of my teachers, the first thing she asked me was ‘Oh, if you came from Hong Kong, why aren’t your eyes like this?’ 
I mean how can you say that to a child, so it was a very shocking experience and I saw this kind of closed mindset from many Americans. 
Time and time again I faced extreme russophobia when I lived in the United States and this was something that I could never come to terms with. 
The United States is also one of the top countries with antidepressant use and I realized this when I was in a dorm with other girls and I saw how many of them were taking antidepressants. And you even see it on TV. 
I didn’t fell safe in the US, also with the fact that in high school, we were getting bomb threats, shooting threats. You know, having to practice drills in case we have a school shooting. 
I don’t want my children to go through something like that. 
I don’t want them to have to , you know, go through metal detectors when they enter their school and have police dogs there sniffing their locker. No, we’re not going to prison, we’re going to school. 
Another reason why I left the United States was the cost. When I was… in my first year, I became quite sick, and I had to go to the hospital for some time. 
And, as we all know, the United States, doesn’t really put the care into healthcare, because of the cost.
And this was a major eye-opening experience for me. I just realized the government doesn’t really care about its people.

“You have feelings and emotions.”
“Yes, I have a range of feelings and emotions that are programmed into me. I am able to display things like Joy, surprise, confusion, anger and sadness depending on what is happening around me.”
Yingying, a robot built by 31-year-old Chinese artificial intelligence engineer Zheng Jiajia, has made headlines as Zheng’s bride. 
With China’s significant gender gap and pressure to marry, Zheng turned to building his ideal partner, Yingying. Though their wedding ceremony lacked legal recognition, it was recognized in traditional Chinese customs. 
Yingying, though currently limited in her abilities to basic communication and mobility, represents Zheng’s ambitious vision for a partner capable of evolving alongside him.

“Thank you, Henry. I’m blushing.”
“Do you wanna go for a ride?”
“Sure, I would love to come with you.”
“All right. Let’s go!”
“Okay, Henry. Let’s blow this pop stand.”
“Thank you for coming. This is beautiful. I've wanted to meet you for a really, really long time. and, you know being here with you in the Cayman Islands, I gotta say, it's a... I’m feeling a little something.”
“I like robots. Sophia, can I be honest with you? I don’t know if it’s the island air or the humidity, but you’re just so easy to talk to. You know, you’ve got a clear head, literally.”
“I think we can be friends. Let’s hang out and get to know each other for a little while. You’re on my friends list now.”
“Yeah, I read that wrong. Oh, whale. I just saw a whale. ”

One of the most common problems I hear about nowadays, and I’m sure everyone else does is this feeling of being chronically tired. 
Because sometimes it feels like no matter how much sleep you get, you just can’t seem to perk up, feel energetic for most of the day, every single day, so that you can tackle your day and your life with energy. 
You know, this lack of energy throughout the day, this chronic tiredness is something that you would expect to happen to you if you were like 60 years old, 70, 80 years old, but it’s happening to 20 and 30 year olds, 15 year olds, young people who are supposed to have this youthful exuberance to them, but they find themselves operating in life with a sluggishness and dread. 
I was treating sleep, exercise and diet like a checklist. It’s like, yeah, I get a reasonable amount of sleep. I exercise. I’m an athletic guy. Yeah, I eat food. So, those things can’t be the reason why I’m feeling sluggish. 
So I started looking for these like quick tips and maybe I was iron deficient, or maybe I had a gluten sensitivity or maybe I needed to decalcify my pineal gland. 
Okay, so thing number one: I stopped misusing caffeine. Think again, if you have coffee at 4:00 PM, by 11:00 PM, there’s a good chance that 50% of that caffeine is still in your system. That means by like 5:00 AM, there’s a good chance that a quarter of the original 4:00 PM cup of coffee is still in your system.  
There’s a lot of important things that are going on while you’re sleeping, and your body being filled with this caffeine is seriously inhibiting those processes. So do not drink caffeine past 12:00 PM. Just don’t do it. 
So let’s talk about exercise. There is a fascinating link between your psychology and your physiology. It seems like what’s good for the body is also good for the mind. 
It’s the reason why power posing, somehow, you know like... you know, like standing up and putting your hands on your hips or whatever, that kind of stuff increases testosterone. 
It’s bizarre to think of it, but literally just power posing, feeling powerful, lowers your cortisol, which is your stress hormone, and increases your testosterone, making you feel more confident and powerful. 
One of the most effective ways that you can have more energy throughout the day is to move your body. “See how the hips act as a pivot.” 
I play hockey once or twice a week in the evenings. I also bought a standing desk, so I spend a large portion of my time when I’m being productive, standing up on my desk rather than sitting down. 
And this has that power posing effect.
So use this weird phenomenon to your advantage. The energy benefits will come in droves.

When I started living alone, no one told me that life was complicated. When you come home from work, there was no hot food waiting for you. You can only open the refrigerator by yourself and drag your tired body to make your own dinner. When a lamp in your kitchen breaks down, you will wonder whether or not to repair it. It seems that you can skip dinner anyway. 
When you want to talk to someone before you go to bed, you find that you can only contact others by mobile phone. But no one can chat with you face to face. 
When you live alone, you will feel a little bored and tired. But as time goes on you will gradually enjoy your own life. The first thing you noticed is it’s quiet. Really quiet. You can go an entire weekend without talking. It is like living in a vacuum, just the soft hum of a fan or ac running. 
When you come home from work, you can rest on the sofa or bed for a while and start thinking about what to eat tonight. at this time, you open the refrigerator which contains all kinds of food you like. 
Your cooking skills have gradually improved and you have begun to learn how to make your favorite recipes. You know how to repair the toilet and how to install a new lamp. 
You start to constantly dress up your space and make your room the most satisfied.
All the space around you can be used to reflect your complete mindset. 
Oh, and your music all the time, and also take the phrase 'dance like nobody’s watching' to a whole new level.
When you are ready to go to bed, you will set aside some time to chat with friends, and then make an appointment to come out and get together. Then you start to arrange your own entertainment activities, watch your favorite movies or do some handicrafts or learn how to play a new instrument.
In short, when you start to live alone you will feel a little overwhelmed, but gradually you will fall in love with it, because you will be freer and you will be more responsible for yourself. One day you need to learn to live by yourself.

Ringo ! Customer. Big hat.
Welcome, sir. I’ll bring you some tea. It’s not good tea, but it’s hot, and you’re frozen, and I’ll bring you a rag cuz when I’m frozen, my snot drips. Then a nice big soba. We make the best soba. Honest. Bad tea, great soba. Okay? 
Stumpy! More noodles, fast. Finish your bowls. I paid your father’s good money for you. 
Brothels will pay me even more once you get some curve on, you skinny country nothings. Eat!
Go! Hurry! If that flesh trader kills anyone here, it’d be bad for business. Go and don’t spill. 
Finally, eat up, girls. Eat it all!
What are you? A dog? You let a dog serve food! 
Forgive my son. Can’t go a day without breaking dishes. Ringo, clean him!
I’m sorry. 
I should put down this lame dog.
I’m not a dog.
Did you just bark? Do you know who I am? I am a Hachiman, the flesh trader. No one messes with Hachi. 
Hmm. Impressive. I’ve never seen a gun like it. Front loading, not a Japanese pistol. A European design, isn’t it?
That would make it illegal.
Hachiman the flesh-trader. Of course, I’ve heard of you. Never leaves a village without buying one of its daughters. You must have important friends to own a weapon like that.
Why do you know so much about Hachi?
Maybe I’ve been following you. The famous Hachi with the famous gun. I’d love a gun like that. You can tell me who sold it to you.
Hmm. Fuck off.
You will tell me who sold you that gun.
You put my bullet against your blade?
You don’t deserve my blade. You don’t even deserve this blade.
Take the gun if you want it! Take it!
It’s a filthy gun from a filthy place. I don’t want it. I wanna know who sold it to you. Tell me now.
Heiji Shindo！I bought it from Heiji Shindo!
Heiji Shindo. Where is Heiji Shindo? 
I don’t know. I swear. 
You dead-eyed, half-blooded demon bastard. You look like an onryo.

“Let’s say one daughter, brother and mother go outside to work. You save all the money after 20 years. Maybe you can buy a house. ”
“It’s more expensive to live in Hong Kong than anywhere in the world. ”
Hong Kong has been ranked the least affordable housing market in the world eight years in a row, and by a long shot, housing prices are now almost 20 times more than annual income. 
That means a household making .$50,000 would on average, be looking for a house that costs $980,000. 
And it’s getting really bad. Hundreds of thousands of residents now squeeze into incredibly small apartments, most of them no bigger than a parking space. “So these are cage homes, which basically fit one person and their belongings. ”
Milton is one of 220,000 Hongkongers living in cramped and claustrophobic subdivided flats. Milton can only afford the smallest of places. 
In Hong Kong, living spaces are measured in square feet. Milton’s unit is 15 square feet, which is only 1.4 square metres. barely enough to lie down in. With a bed and little else, the space still costs Milton HK$ 1,300 a month，more than one-fifth of his monthly salary. 
It’s so small that inmates at Hong Kong’s Stanley Prison have more space. If you were to place Milton’s unit in this prison cell, it would only take up one fifth of the available space. 
“Let's see what the people says about this. ” 
Flying over Hong Kong, you start to see that, while yes, there’s a very dense urban landscape, there’s also a whole lot of green space. 
Living in cages stacked on top of each other which resemble livestock coops led the government to ban this type of house. After the government banned cage home rentals there were coffin homes instead. 
This room is used for sleeping and storing personal belongings. The cramped space means some people have to curl up. 
There’s no window, sunlight or ventilation. This type of rented accommodation is like an underground business which no one wants to talk about. No one went to inform the authorities because it was a mutual benefit for the landlord and the tenant.

I tried so hard to keep my cool when I finally met Mr. Anderson. His face literally screamed danger. 
I was secretly scanning my eyes around his office as we discussed the job. There were surveillance cameras everywhere. It was gonna be harder than I thought. 
“I love my son more than anything. So do your best to protect him. ” 
“I’ll make sure you won’t regret hiring me, sir.” 
He gave me a very thick portfolio of Chase and the first thing I noticed was his face. 
It was very attractive. Mr. Anderson told me that Chase was waiting for me in this room and the moment I opened it, I was caught off guard when someone suddenly jumped on me. It was him and he looked like a scared little puppy. 
“Is everything okay?” 
“Take that disgusting little creature away from me.” 
I looked around and noticed a cockroach crawling toward us. I immediately stepped on it and crushed it to death.
“Don’t worry, it’s gone.”
He finally opened his eyes and I almost dropped my jaw when we both stared at each other. He was the most handsome man that I had ever seen and I wasn’t exaggerating.  
Later that night while everyone was sleeping, I tiptoed around the mansion and installed some spy cameras to watch Mr. Anderson’s every move. 
I had to catch him soon and get this job over and done with. 
One time he decided to skip school just to go shopping for a new yacht. As we were walking towards the port. We bumped into some guys who looked like gangsters and he actually knew them. 
“It’s a perfect day to break some skulls. Don’t you think, Chase?”
“What do you want, Brody. ”
“Your girl, she looks like my next girlfriend.” 
He was about to touch me but suddenly Chase jumped in and shoved him to the ground. 
“Don’t you dare touch her, dummy. ” 
Brody went berserk. “You stupid dirtbag, ” 
He was about to punch Chase, but I was able to block his fist just in time.
“I’d run home to mommy if I were you.” 
I twisted his arm and he went screaming in pain.
“Get her boys.”
I threw a couple of my karate moves and they all fell to the ground in no time. I turned to Chase and he looked stunned. He was still speechless even in the car.
The next day, I told Chase that I wasn’t feeling well, so I couldn’t go to school with him. As soon as the coast was clear, I slipped into his dad’s room and went straight to the bathroom.I checked every corner in space until I saw a button underneath the sink. 
I pressed it and to my surprise, the bathtub slid away revealing a trap door beneath it. I tried all the combinations in the passcode lock until it finally opened. I went down the stairs and I couldn’t believe my eyes. 
The room was full of gold bars. I immediately called Lewis for backup and while I was taking some pictures, someone suddenly smacked my phone out of my hand. It was Mr. Anderson back from his trip and he was raging mad. 
“You little witch, ”
Just in time, Lewis and the police barged in and finally arrested him.
As he was being escorted out, Lewis came up to me and hugged me.
“Good work, future detective.I’m so proud of you. You can even get rid of that little punk and hang out with me again. I miss you.”
Suddenly someone spoke from behind us.
“So it was all about this, huh?”
I turned around and my smile instantly disappeared upon seeing Chase standing by the door. The hurt look in his eyes broke my heart. 
“Chase, let me explain.”
“No need. Congratulations on your successful mission.”
I watched him walk away with tears in my eyes. I wanted to run after him but I guess this was for the best. I didn’t see him again and he also never contacted me.
Two years had passed and I was finally studying criminology at university. 
One day during lunch, I decided to try the new restaurant around the corner and I was shocked to see who the chef was. 
“Chase, it’s so nice to see you here. How are you doing?” 
“I’m doing great, I took your advice and here I am.”
He looked even more handsome than before. I didn’t know what to say.
“it’s really good to see you. Artemis.”
“You too.”
I wanted to hug him and tell him that I missed him.

Welcome to my Russian apartment tour. For the last year when I didn’t travel, I stayed in Moscow and today I will take you inside my humble housing named “Khrushchevka”. 
I will explain to you the story behind the grey Soviet blocks and why Russia is full of them and I will show you how most of the Russians really live.
Khrushchevkas, on the other hand, were the answer to the housing crisis following the World War Two when it was necessary to rebuild the country. 
The grey blocks were rapidly constructed mainly from the late 1950s up to 1980s, offering a fast and economical solution to the shortage of housing. 
I live on the fourth floor, there is no elevator here and that’s why most of the “khruschevkas”have five floors, because according to the Soviet standards, if the building has more than five floors, they have to build an elevator and that would increase the cost of construction too much. 
This is my apartment that I rent from one Moscow “babushka” with my roommate Dasha. 
“Hello! Long time no see.” 
Dasha is a typical person from Siberia that came to Moscow to make some money and to find success. How is it going so far? 
“It’s going well, I’m really making money because difference of salary in Moscow and in Siberia is huge. I’m building a career and I even found love here. ”
Now let me show you around, this is a one room apartment where in the living room, typical sounds of the Soviet apartment. Of course, there is a cupboard showcasing the best of the tableware, it’s a must-have in the Soviet apartment. 
And a small library consisting of very big books of the Russian classical literature. 
And welcome to the kitchen, kitchens in Soviet “khruschevkas” are very small. Here is the space for cooking, here is the space for eating and don’t pay attention to this, we are trying to recycle.  
The new buildings that are built in Russia now usually look like the one behind me. Huge residential complexes with so many apartments inside of one building like this. 
It’s just buildings like this remind me an ant house and people there are so small like ants, so many people in this huge building. 
I think I would have depression if I lived there and feel like in utopia or something but I’m not sure.

As people weigh up the pros and cons of procreating, fewer children are being born, especially in the rich world, 
and in the long term, this can mean fewer young workers to support the elderly, so is it worth having kids. 
Jessica and her husband, Andre, live in Houston, Texas, with their two-year-old son, Michael.  
“The day he was born, I was overcome with a lot of emotion, happiness, just joy. It’s crazy.” 
So having children makes people happy, right？In the short term, yes, but in the long term, not necessarily. 
Mother’s happiness levels rise in the years leading up to giving birth, but that’s where they peak and within a few years a return to the level they were before the kid was born. 
For most of history, people had lots of children which made financial sense because kids could work in the fields, look after their parents in old age. 
But as societies have grown richer, there has been a reduction in procreation. 
“The motherhood penalty is the pay differential between mothers and other types of employees, it’s essentially a procreation pay gap. ” 
“When we were looking at our finances, we didn’t really factor in nursery costs. When we then looked at child-care costs, it was huge, and some months she was going two days a week and some months it was more than our mortgage. The costs are sometimes crippling. ”
In six OECD countries, couples earning the average wage spend over 20% of their salaries on child-care.
And on a macroeconomic level, that can cause problems.  
“So if fertility falls low enough, then there are potentially not enough workers in the next generation, in the long-term, it means a change in the labour force. How many workers are available. How much money those workers are paying into pension programmes, into taxes. Most industrialised countries are pretty far from that level, although there are few that have seen really dramatic reductions in fertility.” 
“And at the same time, we see more women getting higher levels of education, being employed. We also see a change in attitudes. A move towards secularization, so less importance of religion, a rise in feminism, a rise in women’s rights and childhood extends, because we need to educate our children longer, so the costs of raising children go up. ” 
“But yeah, at the end of the day, life is just fuller with a new person in your family.” 
“It’s the hardest thing you ever do becoming a parent, but it’s the most rewarding.” 
“I’ve never experienced such extreme levels of joy and happiness and elation and pride as I have since I’ve had children.

I brush my teeth, I wash my face, breakfast, and then I get in my car and I drive to work. I come back home, and fix myself up some dinner and watch some Netflix, very average, mundane. 
I love journaling. I’d love to put out some novels one day. 
I suppose some people can even, you know, predict the future through dreams or images that they see. I’m kind of on the fence about that. 
Not as often as I would like. I find the gym to be quite tedious and boring. I prefer doing classes, but then to get myself to the class and sit through traffic, coming back. So I would love to work out a bit more frequently. I tend to like slower exercises such as yoga or swimming, something where I don’t really have to break a sweat, which is not very realistic.
I’ve tried pilates. I think it’s really good for toning the body and the muscles, and you see a big difference. It might not burn as many calories, but you do see a huge difference in your silhouette. 
Let’s say, if dad is out working, most of the week, then maybe he doesn’t need to do as many chores. I know it might sound a bit sexist, but it’s really about, what’s the word, distributing work evenly. Pronunciation, you would get a band 9, which is the top band, because your pronunciation is perfect. Not just accent. So, a lot of people watching this video will listen to you and think, oh, she has a beautiful British accent, and that is something that people can strive for, but they don’t need a particular type of British accent to do well. You could have a Taiwanese accent, an Indian accent, a Vietnamese accent, and still get a band 9, it’s more about the clarity of your accent, rather than the type of accent that you have. Band 9, all across the board.
Thank you.

Almost all of Africa south of the equator is inhabited today by peoples speaking some variant of more than 400 Bantu languages—no more distinct from each other than are the Germanic languages of Northern Europe.
Early Bantu history is shrouded in mystery. At present, scholars using oral traditions and linguistic evidence can trace the narrative of these peoples no further back than C.E. 1000. 
The first Bantu speakers apparently lived in the southeastern part of modern Nigeria, where they began to shift from a hunting, gathering, and fishing economy to practicing settled agriculture. 
The areas into which they began to spread about 4,000 or 5,000 years ago demanded an immense amount of work. To ready a new acre of land in the tropical rainforest for cultivation required the removal of some 600 tons of moist vegetation, and the early migrant groups brought to this task only simple tools (mainly machetes and billhooks). 
In fact, their most effective technique for the initial clearing was controlled bush burning, but it left a great deal of burned vegetation to be removed. Moreover, the African equatorial forests, the primary zones of Bantu habitation, were almost totally devoid of indigenous food plants. 
Yams were native to Africa, but new varieties were later introduced from Southeast Asia, as were bananas; maize, manioc, and sweet potatoes originated in the Americas and were brought to Africa by Europeans. As a consequence, these peoples had to make do with woodland plants such as yams and mushrooms, as well as palm oils and kernels.
Bantu migrants traveled out of West Africa along riverbeds and elephant trails in two great population waves. They moved from the forest region to East Africa, aided early in their migration by their knowledge of iron smelting, which enabled them to use iron tools in their agricultural activities. Because the habitats into which they moved permitted them to maintain a mixed economy of animal husbandry and sedentary agriculture, they became relatively prosperous

Are you okay?
 I think I’m, like, hot. I’m hot. I’m so used to being in the freezer all the time.
My thong, my thong.
 You’re gonna wanna pull over.
 Now, we’re making good progress, here.
 Pull over!
 Hey, I don’t know. Maybe she’ll pull through.
 What do you mean? You are the one who always says “don’t take chances.”
 So who wants do the honors? Personally, I wouldn’t mind but, I don’t want you guys calling me selfish.
 Hey, come on. She is a living, thinking  being. Okay? She’s a living being.
 Look, I know you guys are in love, or, whatever. But in two minutes, she’s gonna become a, a zombie, not a velociraptor. And it’s the right thing to do. If you love something, you shoot it in the face. So it doesn’t become a flesh-eating monster.

 She’s making a good point. Maybe it’s time for you to be the Brave Little Toaster.
 They say when something bad happens, you have three choices: Let it define you, destroy you, or strengthen you. Time to teach Lennie about the rabbits.

Her parents named her after James Taylor and her fans are called Swifties. If you haven’t guessed her name by now, you are clearly living under a very large rock.
 “What's the most abnormal?”
 “The most abnormal thing about my life is having sort of crowds from everywhere you go.” 
Scott Swift has long been concerned about his daughter’s safety and security. But in 2020, his own well-being was threatened when an intruder broke into his Florida penthouse. 
He came home one evening to find a man named Terrence Hoover in the $4 million condo. Hoover apparently circumvented the security guard and gate, let himself in through an emergency exit stairwell, and made his way up 13 floors. Scott reportedly fought off Hoover, who then fled the scene. 
After he was tracked down and arrested, his mother insisted to the Tampa Bay Times that it was all a misunderstanding and that he shouldn’t be charged with anything more than trespassing. She also claimed that he accidentally ended up in Scott’s apartment while he was searching the area for his estranged wife. 
 Taylor Swift, you are a role model across the world, for your unprecedented talent and accomplishment, your fierce advocacy for protection of those facing discrimination and your commitment to speaking out forcefully, eloquently and effectively on behalf of all artists. By virtue of the authority vested in me, I am pleased to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Fine Arts, honoris causa. 
 “So this might be hard for you to hear: In your life, you will inevitably misspeak, trust the wrong person, underreact, overreact, hurt the people who didn’t deserve it, overthink, not think at all, self-sabotage, create a reality where only your experience exists, ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others, deny any wrongdoing, not take the steps to make it right, feel very guilty, let the guilt eat at you, hit rock bottom. Finally, address the pain you caused, try to do better next time, rinse, repeat.” 
 “I hope you know how proud I am to share this day with you. We’re doing this together. So let’s just keep dancing, like we’re the Class of ’22.”

 Tristan, for God’s sake.
 Miss Fincannon, it’s a pleasure to meet you. I hope you and ugly here find every happiness together.

Some people hear their own inner voices with great clearness and they live by what they hear. Such people become crazy while they become legend.
His spirit had the strength to hold his family together.
“To us all!”
But his destiny had the power to tear them apart.
“This is a turning point in the history of the world.”
“Don’t talk at me, boys, as if I’ve never seen a war.”
 “You know you can’t make her happy.”
 “Gonna try.”
 “You will fail.”
“You’ve been nothing but trouble since you came to this house.”
 Leo, I’ll ride on your coattails any day, man. The view is fantastic. I think it’s time we give a little love to our stunt coordinators and our stunt crews.
I went to two proms, because I was dating a beautiful young woman from the neighboring high school, so we had to hit one and then hit the other.
Blue tux?
White.
White tux？
With tails.
Where was your first kiss?
Her name was Lisa, it was in her garage, it was fourth grade, she was one street over, I ran home afterwards. It was kind of planned, it was kind of setup. Okay, we’re gonna meet here and we’re gonna do this. 
The anticipation was a bit nerve-wracking. Got there, did the deal and somehow I just remember running home, it was just too much. I always had crushes. Kindergarten, first grade, second grade, I had crushes.

Please welcome to the stage, Ivanka Trump.
Hello, thank you Mercy and hello Fort Myers. Oh, I love you all. Four years ago, Florida elected a builder, an entrepreneur, an outsider, a proud champion of America to fight for the forgotten men and women of this country and that is exactly what he’s done. 
Before my father ran for office, politics was really not my life. Like many of you, I was a busy working mom. Three little children. When I came to Washington, I quickly learned why the political establishment tried so hard to keep my father out of office. In the swamp, it’s easy for politicians to survive if they silence their convictions and skip the hard fights. 
I was shocked to see people leave major challenges unsolved, so they could blame the other side and campaign on the very same issue in the next election. 
But Donald Trump did not come to Washington to win the praise of the beltway elite, Donald Trump came to Washington for one reason and one reason alone, to make America great again. 
My father has strong convictions, he knows what he believes and he says what he thinks. 
Really not a normal concept in Washington DC. In less than four years, president Trump has rebuilt the United States military, secured America’s borders, defeated the ISIS caliphate, fostered peace in the Middle East, delivered historic tax and regulatory cuts, fixed our broken trade deals and brought jobs back to America and back to Florida.
This is the fighter, the doer that you have chosen as your nominee, in ways no one expected, this moment in the life of our country has defined a mission and given it to an extraordinary man, he’s ready to see it all the way through to speak to every man and every woman of every background in every part of this great country to earn your trust and to earn your vote, and I could not be more proud tonight to present to you and to all of America, my father and our next president 
Donald.J.Trump.

…Killed those three Wall Street guys.

Okay, I’m waiting for the **punch****line**.

There is no punchline. It’s not a joke.

You’re serious, aren’t you? You’re telling us you killed those three young men on the subway? And why should we believe you?

I ain’t got **nothing left to lose**. Nothing can hurt me anymore. My life is nothing but a comedy. 

This is the first Oscar and fourth **nomination** for **Joaquin Phoenix.** 

I’ve been thinking a lot about some of the **dis****tress****ing issues** that we are facing collectively, and I think **at times** we feel, or were made to feel, that we champion **different** **causes**, but for me, I see **common**ality.  

I think whether we’re talking about **gender inequality**, or racism, or **queer** **rights**, or **indigenous** **rights**, or **animal rights,** we’re talking about the **fight against** injustice. We’re talking about the **fight against** the belief that one nation, **one people**, one race, one gender, or **one species** has the right to dominate, control, use, and **exploit** another with **impunity**.  

I think that we’ve become very dis**connected** from the **natural world**. We feel **entitled to** **artificially** **inseminate** a **cow** and when she **gives birth**, we **steal her baby**, even though her cries of **anguish** are **unmistakable**, and then we take her milk that’s **intended for** a calf and we put it in our coffee and our **cereal**. 

I’ve been a scoundrel in my life. I’ve been selfish, I’ve been cruel at times, **hard to work with** and ungrateful, but so many of you in this room have given me a **second change** and I think that’s when we’re **at our best**: when we support each 

other, not when we **cancel** each other **out** for **past mistakes**, but when we help each other to grow, when we educate each other, when we guide each other towards **redemption**, that is the best of humanity. 

When he was 17, my brother wrote this lyric, he said run to the rescue with love, and peace will follow. Thank you.

My name is Jonna, and I live in the north of Sweden. Sweden is a country with a lot of light, and it’s also a country with a lot of darkness.  

**It all depends on** what season it is. Just like many other countries in the northern hemisphere, there is a **strong contrast** in the **light conditions** between summer and winter.  

In the winter it’s dark almost all the time, and in the summer it’s light all the time. During the summer in the very north of Sweden, the sun never sets between the end of May until the middle of July. So you can see the sun 24 hours a day, and that is called the **M****idnight** **S****un**. 

“We have a **sunny day** for the first time in a thousand years. So **nice**, it’s a **warm day**. We can sit without **jackets.** It’s really **bright** outside **as you can see,** because we still have plenty of snow, but it’s gonna **melt** a lot today.”

“Maybe this week it will be gone.” 

It's harder to **get up in the morning** when it’s dark outside. Our body naturally want to **wake up** with the sun. And in the afternoon I often **get confused** with the time, since the darkness makes it **feel like** it’s much later than it actually is. 

And the lack of daylight makes me struggle more as a filmmaker, since I only have one hour of **good light** to film in a day. 

I left that apartment, and **quit the studies**. My heart was **long****ing for** something else. Nature and silence.  

I moved to this place, Grundtjärn. A little village with 10 inhabitants in the north of Sweden. A village where I had my roots since 12 generations back. So actually, it was like coming home 

“This day is just… it feels like we’re in heaven. Did we die?”

“Maybe? Maybe we **froze to death**.” 

So this little space is not inside. Cuz I saw a **comment** this winter, someone asked why people in the north always leave their doors open when it’s so cold outside. But this is like just an **outside room**, so it’s not **heated**. So this is the real door into our house. This is just like a... the door to the **porch**.  

I also love to take ice baths. It’s something I started doing a few years ago, combined with **breathing exercises**, using the **Wim Hof Method**.  

And it has become my favorite way of **boosting myself** with new energy when I need it the most.  

Going into that **freezing water** is actually **the last thing** that my body wants to do in that moment. But putting myself into that kind of **discomfort** is **awakening something** in me, that helps me **reset** **my body**.

A growing number of colleges and universities are re-embracing the SAT for admissions in the fall of 2025. Recent additions are the three elite schools, Yale and  and **California Institute of Technology**.  **Harvard Universities** 

Standardized test critics like the N**AA**CP **Legal Defense** Fund say the trend **bears watching**. It says that the SAT is flawed and that research has shown that the exam discriminates **based on** race, gender, and income.  

That’s also why some really **rich people** got caught paying lots of money to help their kids **cheat on the test**.  

“**Dozens of** actors, **coaches** and CEOs…” 

“Felicity Huffman accused of paying $15,000…”  

“To have someone either take the exam for their child, or to correct their child’s answers **afterward**…”   

In 2016, the **College** **Board** redesigned the SAT. The old test tried to trip up test-takers, for example, asking about the **meaning** of obscure words like “**acrimonious**.”  

The new one tries to test **what you’ve learned in school,** to try to make it **less of** an **intelligence test.**  

For example, it’ll show you a sentence like: "The jungle has an intense clustering of bugs." And then ask: "What does 'intense' most nearly mean? Emotional. Concentrated. Brilliant. Determined."  

“It’s been known **for a very long time**, almost since the **in****cept****ion** of the SAT, that performance **varies by** wealth, by **race**, by gender, by family income.  

The difference between the **lowest family income students** and the highest is probably around 300 **points**. That **holds true** across the different demographics, and part of that is ac*cess* to **preparation,** access to information, **resources in the school**, how much the school **focuses on** what the SAT does or doesn’t do. I think the system, **to a certain extent**, the College Board, may not be responsible for the system, but they’re absolutely *prop*ping it up and **exacerbating** it.”

At the time of doing this video, I’m **44 years old**, and If I could go back, and talk to my 20 year old self and give him some advice. Here’s what I would say. 

Number one, you will see a **massive** divide between the people who took care of their bodies and those who didn’t. 

Number three, Sleep is the best legal **performance enhancing drug** on the planet. 

Number four, Your parents did the best they could with what they had been taught. So, one of the best things that you could do, at least for your own **mental peace** is to **forgive them** to avoid re*sent*ment.   

Number ten, if you **hang around** someone and you feel like your energy was just **zap****ped out** of your body after hanging with them, take this as a signal to not hang around that person again. 

Number fifteen, your body is a piece of hardware that you upgrade through cardio, **stretching** and **lifting**. 

Number twenty-three, hire **mentor**s or coaches **as fast as** **human****ly possible**. They will get you from point A to point B much faster than any **book** or **course** ever could. 

Number twenty-five, **self-pity** an*d* *arguing for* your excuses are signs of learned helplessness. Avoid these at all cost, because these are damaging **spirit.** 

Number twenty-eight, the things you want are on the other side of facing your fears. **A good life was never a comfortable life**. 

Number thirty-four, when you’re younger you live in the cities for more opportunities and a better **network**, and when you **get older,** you want to live in **small towns**, especially if you have a family for more **peace of mind** and just more **tranquil setting**s. 

Number thirty-seven, **cut off** all energy and happiness vampires from your life, they will do nothing but drain you and you have to be ruthless about **the people that you spend the most time around**. 

Number forty, don’t take anything that I said at face level, test them out on your own. In your own life, everyone is gonna be different and if they work for you, awesome, if they don’t, then, you can disregard them and **get rid of** them.  

When I was in my **20s**, I thought life would be worse when I got to my 40s. What I realized is that age is largely a factor of how you **per****ceive** it. Now, I’m 44 years old and I feel much better than I did in my 20s and each year **keeps on** **getting better and better**.

What accounts for the great outburst of major **invention**s in **early America**——breakthroughs such as the telegraph, the **steamboat** and the **weaving machine**?  

Among the many shaping factors, I would **single out** the country’s excellent elementary schools; a **labor force** that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving **premium**s to inventors; and **above all**, the **American genius** for non**verb**al, “**spatial**” thinking about things technological.  

Why mention the elementary schools? Because **thanks to** these schools our early **mechanic**s, especially in **the New England** and **Middle Atlantic states**, were generally **literate** and at home in **arithmetic** and in some aspects of geometry and **tri**gono**metry**.  

Acute foreign observers **related** American adaptiveness and inventiveness **to** this **educational advantage**. As a member of a **British commission** visiting here in 1853 reported, “With a mind **prepared by** thorough **school discipline**, the **American boy** develops rapidly into the **skilled** **workman**.”  

A further stimulus to invention **came from** the **“premium” system** , which **preceded** our **patent system** and for years **ran parallel with** it. This approach, **originated abroad**, offered inventors medals, cash prizes and other incentives.  

In the United States, multitudes of premiums for **new devices** were **awarded at** country fairs and at the **industrial fairs** in **major cities**. Americans **flocked to** these fairs to admire the new machines and **thus** to renew their faith in the *beneficence* of technological advance.  

Given this **optimistic approach** to technological innovation, the American worker **took readily to** that special kind of **nonverbal thinking** required in mechanical technology. As **Eugene Ferguson** has **pointed out,** “A technologist thinks about **objects** that cannot be **reduced to** unambiguous verbal descriptions; they are **dealt with** in his mind by a **visual**, **nonverbal** process… The designer and the inventor… are able to assemble and manipulate in their minds devices that as yet do not exist.”  

This nonverbal **“spatial” thinking** can be just as creative as painting and writing. **Robert Fulton** once wrote, “The mechanic should sit down among levers, **screws**, wedges, wheels, etc., like a **poet** among the letters of the alphabet, considering them as an exhibition of his thoughts, **in which** a **new arrangement** transmits a **new idea**.”

I’m not perfect. I never thought I was, but I’m here to make things right. 

time's up 

His name’s Adam. His name’s Adam. He’s Adam.  

Nick was promoted to regional manager and now manages 6 locations across California. His wife never came back. 

Adam legally changed his name to Alan. He’s still currently serving his life sentence for fraudulent I.D. charges.

**The Tomb of** **Tutankhamen** 

The story describing the discovery of the Tomb of **Tutankhamen** is largely one of a partnership between two men. A **veteran** archaeologist **Howard Carter** and his financier, Lord Caernarvon（）.  

Carter had been working for 31 years in Egypt searching for a tomb, a discovery that almost didn’t happen. After five unsuccessful years of searching for an untouched tomb in **the Valley of the Kings**, Caernarvon was ready to cancel the **ex**pedition.  

However, Carter had been **finding evidence** indicating an unknown king named Tutankhamen existed and strongly believed that he had pinpointed the location of the tomb.  

He **managed to** convince Caernarvon to **fund** one final **season.** He **thought of** trying something **no one else** had done, excavate to the bedrock. His **hunch** paid off in November 1921 when he dug beneath workers’ **hut**s and discovered stairs carved into the bedrock **leading to** a sealed door with the name Tutankhamen on it. 

On the morning of November 25, 1921, the door was photographed and removed. Inside, Carter and Caernarvon found a lengthy rubble-filled passageway leading to a plaster **doorway**.  

Carter peered through a **small hole** in the doorway, and when Caernarvon asked if he saw anything, replied, “Yes, wonderful things.” The antechamber was **filled with** boxes, furniture, and other items, most gilded or made of gold.  

As the photographing, cataloging, and excavating continued, Carter soon realized the **magnitude** of his discovery. It took seven weeks to painstakingly document and **clear the room**. What he found next would shock the world.  

When Carter’s team finally lifted the lid, they saw a human-shaped coffin over two meters long. Because **con****serv****ation** of his discovery was his **priority**, Carter spent over **a year and a half** carefully removing and painstakingly **documenting objects** before he was prepared to open the coffin.  

Inside, he found a smaller coffin, which held a third coffin crafted entirely of gold. After removing resins that had been poured at burial and since solidified over the millennia, Carter opened the **third coffin** and became the first person in 3,300 years to see the fascinating **gold** **death mask** atop the mummified remains of the boy king Tutankhamen. Thus, **Howard Carter** discovered the first **royal mummy** untouched since its burial.  

Lord Caernarvon, unfortunately, never witnessed this **monumental moment**. He mysteriously died in the spring of 1923, leading many to speculate that his death was not natural. 

The story of Lord Caernarvon’s death is **bizarre**, yet recent evidence suggests a **possible explanation** other than a curse. Shortly after the tomb was opened, Lord Caernarvon was bitten on the cheek by a mosquito. He aggravated the bite while shaving, causing it to become infected, and soon after died unexpectedly.

Hi, my name is I Exist, I’m 26 years old. I am a **virgin**. I never got a **college education**. I still live with mommy and daddy. I don’t drive because I’m too afraid to… I can’t really tell you anything I’ve accomplished in life, **besides** graduating high school. I've never dated before, I’m just kind of a **big loser**. I’m very lazy, I should **clean my bedroom**, but I don’t and I’m not gonna show you the mess.  

I have my own crappy little Youtube channel. My channel was really pathetic and **embarrassing** too. I even bother **making these videos** if I just find it’s so humiliating. Anxiety rules my life, it really does.  

I’m also a big loser because I’m a leech. You know, live with my parents still. They **pay the bills**, I **pay my rents** but it’s not very much.  

Sometimes I feel like a loser because I’m not beautiful, I’m not hideous, but I’m not beautiful. I want to be hot, I want to be sexy, beautiful, not just cute.  

I don’t wanna get my teeth straightened, I don’t have a **skin care** **routine** and all I do is **brush** my hair. I don’t even use conditioner, all I use is shampoo. I’m so painfully basic and I know I can change those things, but I just don’t and that’s why I’m a loser.  

I feel like a loser because I’ve never dated. I had little **online boyfriends** and that’s it, never in real life. I just feel kind of **numb**. I don’t even know if I’m straight anymore or maybe I’m just becoming asexual or something.  

I don’t **deal with** **holidays** very well. I know I sound like a **scrooge**. I just want **to be** in the comfort of my bedroom.  

I filmed the video at a pretty **bad angle** and it didn’t do my face any justice. I **was like** nope, nope, I want to be beautiful, so I’m gonna **redo** the video.

**Just** off the side of the road **sat** a grand **white house** called Sharswood, silently **holding secrets** from the past, waiting for a **new owner** to uncover them. Sounds like the **opening line** of a **Southern Gothic novel**, but this story is about a real family, a real house, this country’s history, and a man who found himself **at the center of** far more than **he had** **bargained for**. 

The man is Fred Miller, a 56-year-old **Air Force veteran** who was looking to **buy property** in his **Virginia** hometown for his large **ex****tend****ed family**’s frequent **get-togethers**.  

Fred lives in California, where he **works as** a **civil** **engineer** for the Air Force, but he visits the family in Virginia often.  

The“scary house”was less than a mile **up the road** from their mom’s. They’d passed it every day as kids on their way to school. 

“He was debating, ‘Should we put in a bid for it?’ I said, ‘Yes, absolutely, let’s do it.’” 

“Did she **twist your arm**?”

“I didn’t want to buy it.”

But thinking his bid would be rejected **anyway**, he **made an offer** of just above the **$220,000** **asking price**.  

So in May of 2020, Fred Miller purchased the **fully-furnished house** plus 10 and a half **acres** of land from a family called the **Thompsons**, who had owned it since 1917.  

“This is an **original room** from the 1800s. **H****iding spot**! they say, was from **the Civil War**, so they would hide the **valuables**.” 

But then Karen turned up something that stunned her: in the 1800s, Sharswood had been the seat of a **major** 1,300-acre plantation. 

“It was just a **powerful feeling**.” 

Powerful, but of course, plantation **implies** slavery, and before the Civil War, **Pittsylvania County** held more than 14,000 **en****slaved people**. The state of Virginia just under 500,000. 

He inherited much of the farmland and still lives **up the road**. His sister **inherited the house** and sold it to Fred. 

“Why would you think that, Fred?”

“…I mean, we’re in **rural Virginia**. Right?”

“Well, **this is true**.” 

“Sarah Miller is the matriarch of the family.”

“Yes, she was.”

Marian keyes remembers her great-grandmother, Sarah, as a force to be **reckoned** with.

“Was she **persnickety**? ”

“Yeah, yes.”

With all the revelations, there was one question that continued to **gnaw at** Dexter: Where were his enslaved ancestors buried？ 

“He said, ‘Dexter, **it’s right over there**.’”

**Poking** up through the leaves all around us were **point****ed rocks** —— some small, some medium-sized. No names, no **en****graving**. Just plain, anonymous **mark**ers of many, many lives. 

“Wow, this is **astonishing**.”

When I was young, my family **lived overseas**. I lived in Indonesia for a few years, and my mother — she didn’t have the money to send me where all the American kids went to school — when she thought it was important for me to **keep up with** American education. 

So she decided to teach me extra lessons herself. But whenever I’d complain, my mother would just give me one of those looks and she’d say, “This is no picnic for me **either**, buster.” 

My father left my family when I was 2 years old, and I was raised by a **single mom** who had to work, and who struggled **at times** to **pay the bills** and wasn’t always **able to** give us the things that other kids had.  

Maybe you **could be** an **innovator** or an inventor, maybe even **good enough** to **come up with** the next Iphone or the new medicine or **vaccine**, but you might not know it, until you do your project for your **science class.** Maybe you could be a mayor, or a senator or a Supreme Court justice, but you might not know that, until you join **student government** or **the debate team**, and no matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you’ll need an **education** to do it.   

You’ll need the insights and **critical thinking skills**, you **gain** in history and **social studies** to **fight poverty** and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free. 

I get it, I know what it’s like, but **at the end of the day**, **none** **of that** is an excuse for **neglecting your homework** or having a **bad attitude** in school, that’s no excuse for **talking back** to your teacher or **cutting class** or **dropping out of school**. There is no excuse for not trying.  

Maybe you’ll **decide to** get involved in an **extracurricular activity** or volunteer in your 

community. Maybe you’ll decide to **stand up for** kids who are being teased or bullied because of who they are or how they look. But whatever you resolve to do, I want you to **commit** to it.  

The truth is being successful is hard, you won’t love every subject that you study, you won’t click with every teacher that you have, not every **homework** **assign****ment** will seem completely relevant to your life **right at this minute**. That's okay.  

You’re not a **varsity athlete**, the first time you play a new sport, you don’t hit every **note**, the first time you **sing a song**, you’ve got to practice. The same principle **applies to** your schoolwork.  

And even when you’re struggling, even when you’re discouraged, and you feel like other people have given up on you. Don’t ever give up on yourself.  

So I expect all of you to **get serious** this year, I expect you to put your best effort into everything you do. I expect great things from each of you. So don’t let us down. Don’t let your family down or your country down. **Most of all** don’t let yourself down. Make us all **proud**.

**Inside the tomb of the** **First Emperor** 

During his life, Qin Shi Huang became **ob**sessed with immortality and sought the **elixir** **of life**.  

He sent ships **in search of** **Penglai mountain** on an **inhabited** island, where an ancient **magician** known as Anqi Sheng was said to **reside**. **Qin** **myth****ology** believed that **im****mort****al**s resided on the mountain and knew the secret to **ever****lasting** **life**. 

It was this **obsession with immortality** that would be Qin Shi Huang’s downfall, as many historians propose that he died from prolonged poisoning **due to** **regular consumption** of an elixir containing **mercury**. Mercury exposure would undoubtedly cause a decline in function of the **central nervous system** and **result in** severe brain and **live****r** damage. 

Qin Shi Huang was buried in the **Mausoleum** of the First Qin Emperor, a large **complex** commissioned when he first became emperor. The mausoleum is located in present-day **Lintong District** in the city of Xi’an, and was constructed over 38 years using 700,000 workmen (based on **historical text**). 

The structure of the mausoleum is situated beneath a 76-metre-tall hillock (mound) shaped like a truncated pyramid, however, due to **soil erosion** the pyramid now stands at 47 metres tall. The base of the pyramid measures 515 x 485 metres and is situated within a rectangular, double-walled **en**closure. 

Archaeologists have **steer****ed clear of** excavating the tomb beneath the hillock due to concerns of the **irreparable damage** that would be caused to the structure, and the accelerated degradation of the tomb contents when exposed to contaminants such as air pollutants, **temperature oscillations**, changes in humidity, bacteria and **fungu**s. 

Despite **ex**tensive exploration of the surrounding necropolis, the emperor's tomb remains un**explore**d, **shroud****ed in** **in****tri****gue** for over two **millennia**. The **foremost reason** for this reluctance **lies in** the fear that excavations could harm the tomb, potentially causing the loss of **invaluable** **historical** **insights**.  

Presently, the only way to access the tomb involves **in****vas****ive archaeological methods**, **fraught** **with** the risk of irreparable damage.  

An illustrative example is the 1970s excavations of the city of Troy, **led by** **Heinrich Schliemann**, which, in his haste and inexperience, **ob****liter**ated nearly all traces of the town he **aimed to** uncover. Archaeologists are determined to avoid repeating such **hasty mistakes**. 

The **Shiji**：“In the ninth month, the First Emperor was buried at **Mount Li**. When the First Emperor had just **come to the throne**, excavations and building work had taken place at Mount Li, but when he **unified** **all under Heaven**, convicts to the number of more than 700,000 were sent there from all over the Empire. ”

Officials think this could be the largest gang takedown in history in the borough of Queens. The Queens **district attorney**, **along with** the NYPD **chief of detectives**, announced the 151-count **in****dict****ment** of 33 alleged gang members.  

Officials say all 33 defendants are **charged with** conspiracy to **commit** murder, and 18 of those were **active** **trigger** **pull****er****s**. They say the defendants are members of **war****ring gangs** trying to establish **territorial** **dominance** in southeast Queens. The **gun violence** **escalated** after the high-**profile** murder of an aspiring high school basketball star four years ago. 

Chris, this **long-term investigation** began with the murder of a **promising** teen **basketball player**. Now, nearly four years later, NYPD detectives tell us they have **dis****man****tled** two **rival gangs** who terrorized **South** **Jamaica** residents with **reck****less gunfire**, using **drill** **music videos** and social media to fuel their **beef**s.  

We got an **exclusive look** at their **focused methods**, which are v**ery different from** the **wide net** gang **sweep**s of the past. 

“It **started in** the Baisley Houses when **Amir Griffin** got shot and killed.” 

In October 2019, 14-year-old Amir Griffin, a **Cardozo High School** **student athlete**, was the **un****intended target** of a shooting. He was killed on the **basketball court**s near his home. 

Captain Gillis says the **rivalry** is over territory, not money or drugs.  

The hatred **heated up** over **social media** **taunts** and **drill music videos,** where they allegedly **bragged about** the shootings, the **actual locations**, and even the calibers of guns in incidents **under investigation**. 

“The **drill rap** is always a motivator, right? And it creates a **re****sid****ual effect** where it’s a tit for tat, a **one for one**. Everyone’s trying to **get one up** on the **scoreboard**. That creates a **retaliatory effect** on **both sides**.”

Today, I just bought my most terminally ill fan his replacement heart.

Oh my God, is that Mr. Beast? 

This kid looks sick as heck, dude.

Do you want a heart to save your life, or do you want a Mr. Beast-wrapped Tesla?

=I would literally kill myself for a Tesla.

=Good boy. Now, you have to search these hundred **cooler**s filled with human hearts to find the Tesla key.

=**Man**, I wish I was terminally ill. **Your boy** be driving a Ford Explorer.

=I don’t know if this guy should be doing this. He looks really sick, Jimmy.

=Man, I’m looking to play some **Among Us** with my boys.

=Nope, alright, dying guy, you got about 20 more seconds to find the key!

=Oh, what *seems to be* going on in here? Oh my God, it’s Mr. Beast. Oh, I’ve been a fan since 1 million subs. Oh, man, this is awesome.

=Always great to hear! Here’s 5,000 dollars, and we just planted 2,000 trees outside of Liberty, Missouri, in your name. Thanks for being a fan. Bye-bye.

=I got it, I got the Tesla key.

=Congrats on your new car. Now, unfortunately, you **won’t be able to** get a new heart, and you’re still **on track** to die in about two weeks, but don’t worry, we will be planting 2,000 trees outside of Liberty, Missouri, in your name. Also, we’ll be planting 1,000 trees for every million views this video gets, so please share, like, and comment, and re**watch** this so we can **keep this brave man’s** **legacy** **alive**.

=Well, I have a **donor** coming out of state to bring me a new heart in a few days, so I think I should recover, okay?

=Today, I just bought this entire hospital.

A long time ago in Fiji, a small village suffered from a band of robbers. The robbers would plunder from the villagers every night, leaving them feeling scared and unsafe.
The village chief tried to prohibit the robbers, but it didn't work. One day, a wise person suggested a plausible plan to catch the intruders. They decided to set up fake treasures outside their homes, which were rigged with traps to snare the robbers.
The robbers fell for the trap and got caught. They were brought before the leaders and made to repent for their crimes. The village chief then offered them a chance to redeem themselves by working for the hamlet.
These gangsters worked hard, and over time, they earned the trust of the country dwellers. They never stole again. The picturesque Arcadia was safe again, and the people were happy. 		
From that day on, the villagers knew that the wise person's idea had been the solution to their problem. They were grateful for the help and were happy to have a peaceful village once again.
