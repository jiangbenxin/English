A long time ago in Fiji, a small village suffered from a band of robbers. The robbers would plunder from the villagers every night, leaving them feeling scared and unsafe.
The village chief tried to prohibit the robbers, but it didn't work. One day, a wise person suggested a plausible plan to catch the intruders. They decided to set up fake treasures outside their homes, which were rigged with traps to snare the robbers.
The robbers fell for the trap and got caught. They were brought before the leaders and made to repent for their crimes. The village chief then offered them a chance to redeem themselves by working for the hamlet.
These gangsters worked hard, and over time, they earned the trust of the country dwellers. They never stole again. The picturesque Arcadia was safe again, and the people were happy.
From that day on, the villagers knew that the wise person's idea had been the solution to their problem. They were grateful for the help and were happy to have a peaceful village once again.

Hello friends, it’s Sasha here and today I’m going to be discussing a topic that might be interesting to many of you and it’s why I left the USA. 
I just want to preface this by saying I don’t hate the USA. I don’t want to say that it’s a bad country. 
There’s many wonderful things about the United States, but these are just some of my personal reasons why I just choose not to live there anymore. 
For those of you who don’t know , I was actually born in Hong Kong and I spent most of my childhood there. Hong Kong is a very international and diverse city. All of my classmates in elementary school were from all types of countries. We were very very international. 
So coming from a place like Hong Kong and moving to a very small town in the United States was a major culture shock for me. And I lived in the US for most of my life, ten years, to be exact. 
And even when I went to elementary school, one of my teachers, the first thing she asked me was ‘Oh, if you came from Hong Kong, why aren’t your eyes like this?’ 
I mean how can you say that to a child, so it was a very shocking experience and I saw this kind of closed mindset from many Americans. 
Time and time again I faced extreme russophobia when I lived in the United States and this was something that I could never come to terms with. 
The United States is also one of the top countries with antidepressant use and I realized this when I was in a dorm with other girls and I saw how many of them were taking antidepressants. And you even see it on TV. 
I didn’t fell safe in the US, also with the fact that in high school, we were getting bomb threats, shooting threats. You know, having to practice drills in case we have a school shooting. 
I don’t want my children to go through something like that. 
I don’t want them to have to , you know, go through metal detectors when they enter their school and have police dogs there sniffing their locker. No, we’re not going to prison, we’re going to school. 
Another reason why I left the United States was the cost. When I was… in my first year, I became quite sick, and I had to go to the hospital for some time. 
And, as we all know, the United States, doesn’t really put the care into healthcare, because of the cost.
And this was a major eye-opening experience for me. I just realized the government doesn’t really care about its people.

“You have feelings and emotions.”
“Yes, I have a range of feelings and emotions that are programmed into me. I am able to display things like Joy, surprise, confusion, anger and sadness depending on what is happening around me.”
Yingying, a robot built by 31-year-old Chinese artificial intelligence engineer Zheng Jiajia, has made headlines as Zheng’s bride. 
With China’s significant gender gap and pressure to marry, Zheng turned to building his ideal partner, Yingying. Though their wedding ceremony lacked legal recognition, it was recognized in traditional Chinese customs. 
Yingying, though currently limited in her abilities to basic communication and mobility, represents Zheng’s ambitious vision for a partner capable of evolving alongside him.
“Open settings. Set level. Languages. English. Please save.”
“Saved.”
The team is also hard at work creating a male robot but the advanced AI version won’t be ready for a few months. Until then there’s Henry.
“So, Henry can talk through a voice box but he’s not animated yet.”
“Not yet.”
“Hi, Henry.”
“I never thought I would find anyone like you. I mean, you really have everything I want in a person, you’re charm, good looks, a hot body...”
“Thank you, Henry. I’m blushing.”
“Do you wanna go for a ride?”
“Sure, I would love to come with you.”
“All right. Let’s go!”
“Okay, Henry. Let’s blow this pop stand.”
“Thank you for coming. This is beautiful. I've wanted to meet you for a really, really long time. and, you know being here with you in the Cayman Islands, I gotta say, it's a... I’m feeling a little something.”
“I like robots. Sophia, can I be honest with you? I don’t know if it’s the island air or the humidity, but you’re just so easy to talk to. You know, you’ve got a clear head, literally.”
“I think we can be friends. Let’s hang out and get to know each other for a little while. You’re on my friends list now.”
“Yeah, I read that wrong. Oh, whale. I just saw a whale. ”

One of the most common problems I hear about nowadays, and I’m sure everyone else does is this feeling of being chronically tired. 
Because sometimes it feels like no matter how much sleep you get, you just can’t seem to perk up, feel energetic for most of the day, every single day, so that you can tackle your day and your life with energy. 
You know, this lack of energy throughout the day, this chronic tiredness is something that you would expect to happen to you if you were like 60 years old, 70, 80 years old, but it’s happening to 20 and 30 year olds, 15 year olds, young people who are supposed to have this youthful exuberance to them, but they find themselves operating in life with a sluggishness and dread. 
I was treating sleep, exercise and diet like a checklist. It’s like, yeah, I get a reasonable amount of sleep. I exercise. I’m an athletic guy. Yeah, I eat food. So, those things can’t be the reason why I’m feeling sluggish. 
So I started looking for these like quick tips and maybe I was iron deficient, or maybe I had a gluten sensitivity or maybe I needed to decalcify my pineal gland. 
Okay, so thing number one: I stopped misusing caffeine. Think again, if you have coffee at 4:00 PM, by 11:00 PM, there’s a good chance that 50% of that caffeine is still in your system. That means by like 5:00 AM, there’s a good chance that a quarter of the original 4:00 PM cup of coffee is still in your system.  
There’s a lot of important things that are going on while you’re sleeping, and your body being filled with this caffeine is seriously inhibiting those processes. So do not drink caffeine past 12:00 PM. Just don’t do it. 
So let’s talk about exercise. There is a fascinating link between your psychology and your physiology. It seems like what’s good for the body is also good for the mind. 
It’s the reason why power posing, somehow, you know like... you know, like standing up and putting your hands on your hips or whatever, that kind of stuff increases testosterone. 
It’s bizarre to think of it, but literally just power posing, feeling powerful, lowers your cortisol, which is your stress hormone, and increases your testosterone, making you feel more confident and powerful. 
One of the most effective ways that you can have more energy throughout the day is to move your body. “See how the hips act as a pivot.” 
I play hockey once or twice a week in the evenings. I also bought a standing desk, so I spend a large portion of my time when I’m being productive, standing up on my desk rather than sitting down. 
And this has that power posing effect.
So use this weird phenomenon to your advantage. The energy benefits will come in droves.

When I started living alone, no one told me that life was complicated. When you come home from work, there was no hot food waiting for you. You can only open the refrigerator by yourself and drag your tired body to make your own dinner. When a lamp in your kitchen breaks down, you will wonder whether or not to repair it. It seems that you can skip dinner anyway. 
When you want to talk to someone before you go to bed, you find that you can only contact others by mobile phone. But no one can chat with you face to face. 
When you live alone, you will feel a little bored and tired. But as time goes on you will gradually enjoy your own life. The first thing you noticed is it’s quiet. Really quiet. You can go an entire weekend without talking. It is like living in a vacuum, just the soft hum of a fan or ac running. 
When you come home from work, you can rest on the sofa or bed for a while and start thinking about what to eat tonight. at this time, you open the refrigerator which contains all kinds of food you like. 
Your cooking skills have gradually improved and you have begun to learn how to make your favorite recipes. You know how to repair the toilet and how to install a new lamp. 
You start to constantly dress up your space and make your room the most satisfied.
All the space around you can be used to reflect your complete mindset. 
Oh, and your music all the time, and also take the phrase 'dance like nobody’s watching' to a whole new level.
When you are ready to go to bed, you will set aside some time to chat with friends, and then make an appointment to come out and get together. Then you start to arrange your own entertainment activities, watch your favorite movies or do some handicrafts or learn how to play a new instrument.
In short, when you start to live alone you will feel a little overwhelmed, but gradually you will fall in love with it, because you will be freer and you will be more responsible for yourself. One day you need to learn to live by yourself.

Ringo ! Customer. Big hat.
Welcome, sir. I’ll bring you some tea. It’s not good tea, but it’s hot, and you’re frozen, and I’ll bring you a rag cuz when I’m frozen, my snot drips. Then a nice big soba. We make the best soba. Honest. Bad tea, great soba. Okay? 
Stumpy! More noodles, fast. Finish your bowls. I paid your father’s good money for you. 
Brothels will pay me even more once you get some curve on, you skinny country nothings. Eat!
Go! Hurry! If that flesh trader kills anyone here, it’d be bad for business. Go and don’t spill. 
Finally, eat up, girls. Eat it all!
What are you? A dog? You let a dog serve food! 
Forgive my son. Can’t go a day without breaking dishes. Ringo, clean him!
I’m sorry. 
I should put down this lame dog.
I’m not a dog.
Did you just bark? Do you know who I am? I am a Hachiman, the flesh trader. No one messes with Hachi. 
Hmm. Impressive. I’ve never seen a gun like it. Front loading, not a Japanese pistol. A European design, isn’t it?
That would make it illegal.
Hachiman the flesh-trader. Of course, I’ve heard of you. Never leaves a village without buying one of its daughters. You must have important friends to own a weapon like that.
Why do you know so much about Hachi?
Maybe I’ve been following you. The famous Hachi with the famous gun. I’d love a gun like that. You can tell me who sold it to you.
Hmm. Fuck off.
You will tell me who sold you that gun.
You put my bullet against your blade?
You don’t deserve my blade. You don’t even deserve this blade.
Take the gun if you want it! Take it!
It’s a filthy gun from a filthy place. I don’t want it. I wanna know who sold it to you. Tell me now.
Heiji Shindo！I bought it from Heiji Shindo!
Heiji Shindo. Where is Heiji Shindo? 
I don’t know. I swear. 
You dead-eyed, half-blooded demon bastard. You look like an onryo.

“Let’s say one daughter, brother and mother go outside to work. You save all the money after 20 years. Maybe you can buy a house. ”
“It’s more expensive to live in Hong Kong than anywhere in the world. ”
Hong Kong has been ranked the least affordable housing market in the world eight years in a row, and by a long shot, housing prices are now almost 20 times more than annual income. 
That means a household making .$50,000 would on average, be looking for a house that costs $980,000. 
And it’s getting really bad. Hundreds of thousands of residents now squeeze into incredibly small apartments, most of them no bigger than a parking space. “So these are cage homes, which basically fit one person and their belongings. ”
Milton is one of 220,000 Hongkongers living in cramped and claustrophobic subdivided flats. Milton can only afford the smallest of places. 
In Hong Kong, living spaces are measured in square feet. Milton’s unit is 15 square feet, which is only 1.4 square metres. barely enough to lie down in. With a bed and little else, the space still costs Milton HK$ 1,300 a month，more than one-fifth of his monthly salary. 
It’s so small that inmates at Hong Kong’s Stanley Prison have more space. If you were to place Milton’s unit in this prison cell, it would only take up one fifth of the available space. 
“Let's see what the 	says about this. ” 
Flying over Hong Kong, you start to see that, while yes, there’s a very dense urban landscape, there’s also a whole lot of green space. 
Living in cages stacked on top of each other which resemble livestock coops led the government to ban this type of house. After the government banned cage home rentals there were coffin homes instead. 
This room is used for sleeping and storing personal belongings. The cramped space means some people have to curl up. 
There’s no window, sunlight or ventilation. This type of rented accommodation is like an underground business which no one wants to talk about. No one went to inform the authorities because it was a mutual benefit for the landlord and the tenant.

I tried so hard to keep my cool when I finally met Mr. Anderson. His face literally screamed danger. 
I was secretly scanning my eyes around his office as we discussed the job. There were surveillance cameras everywhere. It was gonna be harder than I thought. 
“I love my son more than anything. So do your best to protect him. ” 
“I’ll make sure you won’t regret hiring me, sir.” 
He gave me a very thick portfolio of Chase and the first thing I noticed was his face. 
It was very attractive. Mr. Anderson told me that Chase was waiting for me in this room and the moment I opened it, I was caught off guard when someone suddenly jumped on me. It was him and he looked like a scared little puppy. 
“Is everything okay?” 
“Take that disgusting little creature away from me.” 
I looked around and noticed a cockroach crawling toward us. I immediately stepped on it and crushed it to death.
“Don’t worry, it’s gone.”
He finally opened his eyes and I almost dropped my jaw when we both stared at each other. He was the most handsome man that I had ever seen and I wasn’t exaggerating.  
Later that night while everyone was sleeping, I tiptoed around the mansion and installed some spy cameras to watch Mr. Anderson’s every move. 
I had to catch him soon and get this job over and done with. 
One time he decided to skip school just to go shopping for a new yacht. As we were walking towards the port. We bumped into some guys who looked like gangsters and he actually knew them. 
“It’s a perfect day to break some skulls. Don’t you think, Chase?”
“What do you want, Brody. ”
“Your girl, she looks like my next girlfriend.” 
He was about to touch me but suddenly Chase jumped in and shoved him to the ground. 
“Don’t you dare touch her, dummy. ” 
Brody went berserk. “You stupid dirtbag, ” 
He was about to punch Chase, but I was able to block his fist just in time.
“I’d run home to mommy if I were you.” 
I twisted his arm and he went screaming in pain.
“Get her boys.”
I threw a couple of my karate moves and they all fell to the ground in no time. I turned to Chase and he looked stunned. He was still speechless even in the car.
The next day, I told Chase that I wasn’t feeling well, so I couldn’t go to school with him. As soon as the coast was clear, I slipped into his dad’s room and went straight to the bathroom.I checked every corner in space until I saw a button underneath the sink. 
I pressed it and to my surprise, the bathtub slid away revealing a trap door beneath it. I tried all the combinations in the passcode lock until it finally opened. I went down the stairs and I couldn’t believe my eyes. 
The room was full of gold bars. I immediately called Lewis for backup and while I was taking some pictures, someone suddenly smacked my phone out of my hand. It was Mr. Anderson back from his trip and he was raging mad. 
“You little witch, ”
Just in time, Lewis and the police barged in and finally arrested him.
As he was being escorted out, Lewis came up to me and hugged me.
“Good work, future detective.I’m so proud of you. You can even get rid of that little punk and hang out with me again. I miss you.”
Suddenly someone spoke from behind us.
“So it was all about this, huh?”
I turned around and my smile instantly disappeared upon seeing Chase standing by the door. The hurt look in his eyes broke my heart. 
“Chase, let me explain.”
“No need. Congratulations on your successful mission.”
I watched him walk away with tears in my eyes. I wanted to run after him but I guess this was for the best. I didn’t see him again and he also never contacted me.
Two years had passed and I was finally studying criminology at university. 
One day during lunch, I decided to try the new restaurant around the corner and I was shocked to see who the chef was. 
“Chase, it’s so nice to see you here. How are you doing?” 
“I’m doing great, I took your advice and here I am.”
He looked even more handsome than before. I didn’t know what to say.
“it’s really good to see you. Artemis.”
“You too.”
I wanted to hug him and tell him that I missed him.

Welcome to my Russian apartment tour. For the last year when I didn’t travel, I stayed in Moscow and today I will take you inside my humble housing named “Khrushchevka”. 
I will explain to you the story behind the grey Soviet blocks and why Russia is full of them and I will show you how most of the Russians really live.
Khrushchevkas, on the other hand, were the answer to the housing crisis following the World War Two when it was necessary to rebuild the country. 
The grey blocks were rapidly constructed mainly from the late 1950s up to 1980s, offering a fast and economical solution to the shortage of housing. 
I live on the fourth floor, there is no elevator here and that’s why most of the “khruschevkas”have five floors, because according to the Soviet standards, if the building has more than five floors, they have to build an elevator and that would increase the cost of construction too much. 
This is my apartment that I rent from one Moscow “babushka” with my roommate Dasha. 
“Hello! Long time no see.” 
Dasha is a typical person from Siberia that came to Moscow to make some money and to find success. How is it going so far? 
“It’s going well, I’m really making money because difference of salary in Moscow and in Siberia is huge. I’m building a career and I even found love here. ”
Now let me show you around, this is a one room apartment where in the living room, typical sounds of the Soviet apartment. Of course, there is a cupboard showcasing the best of the tableware, it’s a must-have in the Soviet apartment. 
And a small library consisting of very big books of the Russian classical literature. 
And welcome to the kitchen, kitchens in Soviet “khruschevkas” are very small. Here is the space for cooking, here is the space for eating and don’t pay attention to this, we are trying to recycle.  
The new buildings that are built in Russia now usually look like the one behind me. Huge residential complexes with so many apartments inside of one building like this. 
It’s just buildings like this remind me an ant house and people there are so small like ants, so many people in this huge building. 
I think I would have depression if I lived there and feel like in utopia or something but I’m not sure.

As people weigh up the pros and cons of procreating, fewer children are being born, especially in the rich world, 
and in the long term, this can mean fewer young workers to support the elderly, so is it worth having kids. 
Jessica and her husband, Andre, live in Houston, Texas, with their two-year-old son, Michael.  
“The day he was born, I was overcome with a lot of emotion, happiness, just joy. It’s crazy.” 
So having children makes people happy, right？In the short term, yes, but in the long term, not necessarily. 
Mother’s happiness levels rise in the years leading up to giving birth, but that’s where they peak and within a few years a return to the level they were before the kid was born. 
For most of history, people had lots of children which made financial sense because kids could work in the fields, look after their parents in old age. 
But as societies have grown richer, there has been a reduction in procreation. 
“The motherhood penalty is the pay differential between mothers and other types of employees, it’s essentially a procreation pay gap. ” 
“When we were looking at our finances, we didn’t really factor in nursery costs. When we then looked at child-care costs, it was huge, and some months she was going two days a week and some months it was more than our mortgage. The costs are sometimes crippling. ”
In six OECD countries, couples earning the average wage spend over 20% of their salaries on child-care.
And on a macroeconomic level, that can cause problems.  
“So if fertility falls low enough, then there are potentially not enough workers in the next generation, in the long-term, it means a change in the labour force. How many workers are available. How much money those workers are paying into pension programmes, into taxes. Most industrialised countries are pretty far from that level, although there are few that have seen really dramatic reductions in fertility.” 
“And at the same time, we see more women getting higher levels of education, being employed. We also see a change in attitudes. A move towards secularization, so less importance of religion, a rise in feminism, a rise in women’s rights and childhood extends, because we need to educate our children longer, so the costs of raising children go up. ” 
“But yeah, at the end of the day, life is just fuller with a new person in your family.” 
“It’s the hardest thing you ever do becoming a parent, but it’s the most rewarding.” 
“I’ve never experienced such extreme levels of joy and happiness and elation and pride as I have since I’ve had children.

I brush my teeth, I wash my face, breakfast, and then I get in my car and I drive to work. I come back home, and fix myself up some dinner and watch some Netflix, very average, mundane. 
I love journaling. I’d love to put out some novels one day. 
I suppose some people can even, you know, predict the future through dreams or images that they see. I’m kind of on the fence about that. 
Not as often as I would like. I find the gym to be quite tedious and boring. I prefer doing classes, but then to get myself to the class and sit through traffic, coming back. So I would love to work out a bit more frequently. I tend to like slower exercises such as yoga or swimming, something where I don’t really have to break a sweat, which is not very realistic.
I’ve tried pilates. I think it’s really good for toning the body and the muscles, and you see a big difference. It might not burn as many calories, but you do see a huge difference in your silhouette. 
Let’s say, if dad is out working, most of the week, then maybe he doesn’t need to do as many chores. I know it might sound a bit sexist, but it’s really about, what’s the word, distributing work evenly. Pronunciation, you would get a band 9, which is the top band, because your pronunciation is perfect. Not just accent. So, a lot of people watching this video will listen to you and think, oh, she has a beautiful British accent, and that is something that people can strive for, but they don’t need a particular type of British accent to do well. You could have a Taiwanese accent, an Indian accent, a Vietnamese accent, and still get a band 9, it’s more about the clarity of your accent, rather than the type of accent that you have. Band 9, all across the board.
Thank you.

Almost all of Africa south of the equator is inhabited today by peoples speaking some variant of more than 400 Bantu languages—no more distinct from each other than are the Germanic languages of Northern Europe.
Early Bantu history is shrouded in mystery. At present, scholars using oral traditions and linguistic evidence can trace the narrative of these peoples no further back than C.E. 1000. 
The first Bantu speakers apparently lived in the southeastern part of modern Nigeria, where they began to shift from a hunting, gathering, and fishing economy to practicing settled agriculture. 
The areas into which they began to spread about 4,000 or 5,000 years ago demanded an immense amount of work. To ready a new acre of land in the tropical rainforest for cultivation required the removal of some 600 tons of moist vegetation, and the early migrant groups brought to this task only simple tools (mainly machetes and billhooks). 
In fact, their most effective technique for the initial clearing was controlled bush burning, but it left a great deal of burned vegetation to be removed. Moreover, the African equatorial forests, the primary zones of Bantu habitation, were almost totally devoid of indigenous food plants. 
Yams were native to Africa, but new varieties were later introduced from Southeast Asia, as were bananas; maize, manioc, and sweet potatoes originated in the Americas and were brought to Africa by Europeans. As a consequence, these peoples had to make do with woodland plants such as yams and mushrooms, as well as palm oils and kernels.
Bantu migrants traveled out of West Africa along riverbeds and elephant trails in two great population waves. They moved from the forest region to East Africa, aided early in their migration by their knowledge of iron smelting, which enabled them to use iron tools in their agricultural activities. Because the habitats into which they moved permitted them to maintain a mixed economy of animal husbandry and sedentary agriculture, they became relatively prosperous

Her parents named her after James Taylor and her fans are called Swifties. If you haven’t guessed her name by now, you are clearly living under a very large rock.
 “What's the most abnormal?”
 “The most abnormal thing about my life is having sort of crowds from everywhere you go.” 
Scott Swift has long been concerned about his daughter’s safety and security. But in 2020, his own well-being was threatened when an intruder broke into his Florida penthouse. 
He came home one evening to find a man named Terrence Hoover in the $4 million condo. Hoover apparently circumvented the security guard and gate, let himself in through an emergency exit stairwell, and made his way up 13 floors. Scott reportedly fought off Hoover, who then fled the scene. 
After he was tracked down and arrested, his mother insisted to the Tampa Bay Times that it was all a misunderstanding and that he shouldn’t be charged with anything more than trespassing. She also claimed that he accidentally ended up in Scott’s apartment while he was searching the area for his estranged wife. 
 Taylor Swift, you are a role model across the world, for your unprecedented talent and accomplishment, your fierce advocacy for protection of those facing discrimination and your commitment to speaking out forcefully, eloquently and effectively on behalf of all artists. By virtue of the authority vested in me, I am pleased to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Fine Arts, honoris causa. 
 “So this might be hard for you to hear: In your life, you will inevitably misspeak, trust the wrong person, underreact, overreact, hurt the people who didn’t deserve it, overthink, not think at all, self-sabotage, create a reality where only your experience exists, ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others, deny any wrongdoing, not take the steps to make it right, feel very guilty, let the guilt eat at you, hit rock bottom. Finally, address the pain you caused, try to do better next time, rinse, repeat.” 
 “I hope you know how proud I am to share this day with you. We’re doing this together. So let’s just keep dancing, like we’re the Class of ’22.”

The anticipation was a bit nerve-wracking. Got there, did the deal and somehow I just remember running home, it was just too much. I always had crushes. Kindergarten, first grade, second grade, I had crushes.

Please welcome to the stage, Ivanka Trump.
Hello, thank you Mercy and hello Fort Myers. Oh, I love you all. Four years ago, Florida elected a builder, an entrepreneur, an outsider, a proud champion of America to fight for the forgotten men and women of this country and that is exactly what he’s done. 
Before my father ran for office, politics was really not my life. Like many of you, I was a busy working mom. Three little children. When I came to Washington, I quickly learned why the political establishment tried so hard to keep my father out of office. In the swamp, it’s easy for politicians to survive if they silence their convictions and skip the hard fights. 
I was shocked to see people leave major challenges unsolved, so they could blame the other side and campaign on the very same issue in the next election. 
But Donald Trump did not come to Washington to win the praise of the beltway elite, Donald Trump came to Washington for one reason and one reason alone, to make America great again. 
My father has strong convictions, he knows what he believes and he says what he thinks. 
Really not a normal concept in Washington DC. In less than four years, president Trump has rebuilt the United States military, secured America’s borders, defeated the ISIS caliphate, fostered peace in the Middle East, delivered historic tax and regulatory cuts, fixed our broken trade deals and brought jobs back to America and back to Florida.
This is the fighter, the doer that you have chosen as your nominee, in ways no one expected, this moment in the life of our country has defined a mission and given it to an extraordinary man, he’s ready to see it all the way through to speak to every man and every woman of every background in every part of this great country to earn your trust and to earn your vote, and I could not be more proud tonight to present to you and to all of America, my father and our next president 
Donald.J.Trump.
